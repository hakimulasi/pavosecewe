(Following their split, the actress sued Joe in September 2023, <a href=#>claiming that he is wrongfully detaining their children</a> in the U.S., <a href=#>which he denies</a>.)</p><p>“Joe’s family understands that no matter what has happened between him and Sophie, that there are children involved so they’ll always be in each other’s lives,” the insider added. “They’re proud of him for putting the children’s needs first and doing what’s best for them. It’s not an easy time, but right now they are just being there for Joe for anything he may need.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Joe’s inner circle:</p><h3>Kevin and Nick Jonas</h3><p>Two of Joe’s biggest supporters are undoubtedly his brothers and bandmates, whom he has been<a href=#> leaning on during his ongoing drama</a> with Turner.</p><p>During a September 2023 performance of<a href=#> the Jonas Brothers song “Hesitate”</a> — which Joe wrote for Turner — Kevin and Nick were there for their brother in a big way.

The Jonas Brothers’ parents <a href=#>appeared to get emotional</a> during one of the band’s performances of “Hesitate” after Joe’s divorce filing.</p><p>Nick, for his part, proved his devotion to his brothers in <a href=#>a 2019 Instagram post</a>.</p><p>“Happy National best friend day everyone,” he wrote alongside a photo of him, Kevin, Joe and Frankie. “Me with mine … they also happen to be the best brothers in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>DNCE</h3><p>After the Jonas Brothers’ hiatus in 2013, Joe fronted another band — the ever-catchy DNCE — who hit the music scene by storm with their 2015 smash, “Cake by the Ocean.” After releasing two EPs and an album, the group — made up of Joe, guitarist <strong>JinJoo Lee</strong>, drummer <strong>Jack Lawless</strong> and bassist-keyboardist <strong>Cole Whittle</strong> — went on hiatus in 2018.</p><p>In an interview with Glass magazine that same year, per <a href=#>Just Jared</a>, Joe described the band’s personal and professional relationship as “just four friends who want to play music, and whether it’s for a week or for the rest of our lives, we’ve decided to let go and just have fun with it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Joe-Jonas-Inner-Circle-2.jpg><h3>Diplo</h3><p><a href=#><strong>Diplo</strong></a> not only <a href=#>live-streamed Jonas and Turner’s not-so-secret Vegas nuptials</a>, he later attended (and performed) at their wedding in France. “It was beautiful,” the DJ recalled of the pair’s ceremony in a September 2023 interview with <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. As <a href=#>for the duo’s split</a>, he told Cohen, “I wish them all the love because I think they have some children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Vit7C6wKxkoqaemr9ur8irmqWdXZ%2B8r63SZpmrp6SdsrO%2FjJqlnWWdpL%2BmecKeo56aXaWurb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
