The couple, who will no longer use their HRH status and will no longer represent the Queen, have agreed to repay the £2.4million of taxpayers' money spent on refurbishing their Windsor home. The private couple may not have shared the full details of their renovations, but from time to time we are given rare glimpses of the couple's interior design choices.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=ef55GuuEfaFAa data-wc=12><strong>WATCH VIDEO:&nbsp;Harry</strong> <strong>and Meghan will no longer use their HRH status</strong></p><p id=ewCpEWfCKUQt- data-wc=56>Of course one of the most important of Meghan's decor decisions involved creating a gorgeous nursery for baby Archie. For this, the couple reportedly&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>hired Vicky Charles, Soho House's top interior designer</a>, to transform Frogmore Cottage into a new baby haven ahead of their move to Windsor.

Meghan and Harry were thought to have chosen gifts for their wedding list from the Soho Home range.&nbsp;It was first thought that Meghan and Daniel may have headed to Oxfordshire's Soho Farmhouse for their meet-up – but the beauty expert took to his Instagram Story to reveal that Meghan had hosted at home.
