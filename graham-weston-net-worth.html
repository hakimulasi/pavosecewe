Graham Weston is one of the founders of the IT hosting company Rackspace. He also serves as Chairman of the Board. Coming from a ranching family in the San Antonio region of Texas, Graham was surrounded by entrepreneurial opportunities from his early childhood. Actually, he was only a seventh grader when he started his first business venture related to marketing organic pork in newspaper ads that read "Go Hog Wild!". While in high school, he got other business ideas on his mind, including a company that took photos at livestock shows and selling them to contestants. As a student at Texas A&M, Weston again came up with and launched a new business, this time in the field of real estate.</p><p>This business lead his family to buy and develop the Weston Centre in downtown San Antonio. It was during this period that he saw a great opportunity and developed a keen interest in the Internet. In 1998, Graham along with a partner put up the initial capital for a business idea called "Rackspace.com" which was pitched by three local Trinity University students. The investment turned out to be a huge success. Graham soon joined Rackspace as CEO, a position he held until 2006. Apart from having a sharp business acumen, Weston is also a great philanthropist who provided a temporary shelter for more than 2,500 victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Ultimately, he was named a 2006 "Best Boss" by Fortune Small Business magazine and also was recognized as regional Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGeXp66prcxmrp6rpKS7brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
