Kelly having sex with a minor surfaced, Andrea was in the last months of her third pregnancy. After the news broke, R. Kelly reportedly forced Andrea to leave Chicago for Florida where she was without friends or family, as she revealed in the doc, "Surviving R. Kelly."&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the stress from the scandal, coupled with the physical and emotional abuse she had long suffered in the singer's hands, would go on to affect her unborn baby.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>During one of Andrea's visits to the hospital, doctors struggled to find the baby's heartbeat, leaving them no other option than to induce labor. "I went through the labor and I just remember falling so in love with little Rob because he came here so strong. I was in that much stress," Andrea explained.</p><p dir=ltr>And then after having the baby, Andrea was yet again forced to live through the news of R. Kelly's child pornography indictment. "I was (sitting) with the baby, and then it comes across the screen like, 'R&B singer R. Kelly has been arrested for child pornography.' And I just remember my best friend was with me, and she said she didn't know what happened, but my body went limp, and she said she caught little Rob before he hit the floor," she recounted in an episode of the miniseries.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
