Now it remains only to release the long-awaited album “All Smiles.”
A$AP Rocky has posted a clip of “DMB” in which he proposes to Rihanna. He called the singer to marry in a very original way: the rapper put grills on his teeth with the words “Marry Me” (“Marry me”).
The video was shot by the artist himself – the video “DMB” became his directorial debut."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now it remains only to release the long-awaited album “All Smiles.”<br>A$AP Rocky has posted a clip of “DMB” in which he proposes to Rihanna. He called the singer to marry in a very original way: the rapper put grills on his teeth with the words “Marry Me” (“Marry me”).<br>The video was shot by the artist himself – the video “DMB” became his directorial debut. Now the couple is expecting a baby, but the work on the video took place in the summer of 2021, so Rihanna appears in it in a “pre-pregnant” form.</p><p>One of the producers of the composition was Skepta, a popular British rapper. The track “DMB” is expected to be featured on A$AP Rocky’s new album “All Smiles,” with a release date yet to be announced. Last spring, the rapper said that Morrissey had a hand in the record, and Rihanna had an influence on her. The recording of “All Smiles” took place last summer during a joint trip with Rihanna to the United States. Their bus contained a mobile studio. So perhaps the singer can be heard on the album – according to the rapper, Rihanna influenced his new songs. A$AP Rocky also confirmed long-standing dating rumors.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>One star guest on the album “All Smiles” will definitely be quite unexpected. They became Morrissey, with whom A$AP Rocky worked remotely. Morrissey not only recorded vocals but also helped the rapper write and produce songs. A$AP Rocky really enjoyed the collaboration:<br>A$AP Rocky’s latest album, Testing, was released in 2018. In 2019, he released the video “Babushka Boi,” and in 2021, he took part in the recording of the album Slowthai “Tyron.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRlr1uvs6corJlkai4tHnRop%2Bapp6WerW7jKaYq6qpYravedOhnGacnZd6t7XDnqZmbWFuhnmDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
