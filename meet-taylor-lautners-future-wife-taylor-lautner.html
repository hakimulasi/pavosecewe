Dome, who prefers to go by the nickname “Tay,” was born on March 17, 1997, in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Malibu. She is a healthcare worker and was studying to be a nurse when she and Lautner first got into a relationship.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TAY (@taydome)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>In 2019, she became a registered nurse after completing her studies at the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita. She thanked Lautner in a heartfelt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a> for being her source of encouragement even when she felt like giving up when getting through the nursing program became too difficult and tedious. Apparently, someone fits Merriam Webster’s definition of the best boyfriend ever!</p><p>“Thank you for encouraging me when I felt like quitting. Thank you for all the meals you’d make me when I was too busy studying. Thank you for quizzing me and trying to pronounce medical terms and abbreviations. Thank you for your calming hugs when I would be getting an anxiety attack. Thank you for supporting me endlessly. You mean the world to me & I wouldn’t be where I am today without you.”</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Dome has been working professionally as a nurse ever since, as in May 2021, she celebrated Nurses Week on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> with a few snaps of herself hard at work. She also gave a shoutout to others who have made the decision to devote their lives to the profession of healthcare, “Thank you for all you have given, your drive to keep going, and your heart of gold,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TAY (@taydome)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Apart from working as a nurse, Dome also runs a website <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LEMONS by Tay</a>, which advocates why one should put self-care and mental health first as well as sells products that assist in caring for the same. Her aim is to end the stigma around the two topics by spreading more awareness and ensuring that more people feel heard and have access to help when they need it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>She also started The Lemons Foundation, which is geared toward providing resources and aiding in the goal of attaining better mental health.

But fate had other plans for the Twilight star as it intervened in the form of his sister, Makena Moore, who called up in January that year to tell her brother how she had found his soulmate.&nbsp;</p><p>“She called me and said, ‘Dude, I found your future wife. You need to meet this girl.’ And the rest is history.”</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Though it is unknown at what point in time Lautner found himself agreeing to his sister’s words or when he and Dome entered into a relationship, they made it public when they went <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>-official in 2018. Lautner shared an adorable picture of himself with his ladylove wherein the pair were seen wearing matching Halloween costumes — as members of the Tune Squad from the movie Space Jam.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>From then on, Lautner and Dome’s respective Instagram profiles bore witness to the growing relationship of the couple as they celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, and festivals together.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Having found the perfect partner in each other, the pair soon announced their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">engagement on Instagram</a> in November 2021 with a picture of Lautner proposing to Dome in front of a neon sign saying “Lautner.” “And just like that, all of my wishes came true,” Lautner wrote, while Dome shared the same picture on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> with the caption, “My absolute best friend … I CANNOT WAIT TO SPEND FOREVER WITH YOU.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taylor Lautner (@taylorlautner)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>If the flashing neon sign wasn’t a hint enough for us that Dome would be taking up her soon-to-be husband’s last name, Lautner confirmed the same during his recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> — that no matter how weird or eccentric it sounds — his fiancée would be swapping “Dome” with his last name after they get married.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>As for the world of confusion they will be setting off, Lautner believes that it is possible that they may be able to sidestep all the jumbled mess their exact same names will cause as he is called Taylor while his fiancee prefers the nickname “Tay.” Though he admitted that there are times when people “just do ‘boy Tay’ and ‘girl Tay'” when they need to point them out.</p><h2 id=h-not-just-the-fictional-bella-swan-taylor-dome-used-to-be-team-edward-too data-injectable=false>Not just the fictional Bella Swan, Taylor Dome used to be Team Edward too</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Taylor-Lautner-and-Taylor-Dome-2-1.jpg><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>Diehard Twilight fans know how much it hurt everyone on Team Jacob when Bella turned down the loyal werewolf — played by Taylor Lautner in the films — in exchange for a happily-ever-after with her sparkling vampire boyfriend Edward.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>Turns out, in real life too Lautner ended up being a second choice as Dome also used to be on Team Edward. In a funny Instagram video, wherein Dome took part in the viral “show your childhood crush and then the person you ended up with” trend, she revealed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she used to have a huge crush on Robert Pattinson</a> as Edward Cullen in the Twilight films.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>“I think it’s time to come clean … ” Dome wrote in the caption.
