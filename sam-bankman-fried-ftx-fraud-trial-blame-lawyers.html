Four former FTX executives, including Ellison, who led Alameda, have already pleaded guilty to separate fraud charges.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Bankman-Fried is charged by the US government with seven counts of conspiracy</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg</span></figure><p>Bankman-Fried has argued he made mistakes, but never intended wrongdoing.</p><p>The trial will be closely watched by FTX’s one million creditors. Louise Abbott, a partner at Keystone Law which is representing claimants in separate bankruptcy proceedings, says: “Creditors want to see justice being done.”</p><p>Starting on Tuesday, Bankman-Fried’s defence will be weighed against the millions of pages of evidence, private messages and audio recordings that have been gathered by the US government.</p><p>According to legal papers submitted before the trial, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers will argue he was just doing what he had been told was legal – a so-called “advice of counsel” defence – or blame the lawyers.</p><p><a class=ck-custom-link href=#>FTX imploded last November</a> in a matter of days after the missing billions in its accounts were revealed. John Ray, the bankruptcy expert who later took control of the business, called its corporate systems a “dumpster fire”.&nbsp;</p><p>The US prosecutors allege this was all as a result of Bankman-Fried’s failed money-making scheme. FTX secretly inflated the value of a cryptocurrency token it controlled, called FTT, that made up the majority of its assets, while using customer deposits to help Alameda borrow billions of dollars to fund trades – in violation of its own terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>After a mass sell-off of FTT, the scheme unravelled.</p><p>Prosecutors argue Bankman-Fried masterminded these plans and used “billions of dollars in stolen funds” to buy up luxury property and donate to political campaigns.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of using stolen customer funds to buy up luxury property including a penthouse in the Bahamas</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: PLANET PHOTOS</span></figure><p>Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty. In a letter disclosed to the court, Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, argues that FTX’s legal advisers, which included Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West, “gave him assurance he was acting in good faith” when he used apps that automatically deleted records at FTX and set up huge loans to company executives.</p><p>The letter named three other FTX lawyers involved in “approving decisions”. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried has publicly criticised another law firm FTX used, Sullivan & Cromwell, for allegedly pressuring him into declaring bankruptcy. In the bankruptcy case, Sullivan & Cromwell called Mr Bankman-Fried’s claims “false”.</p><p>Fenwick & West declined to comment. Sullivan & Cromwell did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Martin Auerbach, head of the white collar and investigations practice at the law firm Withersworldwide in New York, says Bankman-Fried is likely to try to show he had “surrounded himself with the best and brightest and paid them a lot of money” to advise him on the legality of his actions.</p><p>Typically, this also requires the defendant to provide evidence they had given their lawyers the information they needed to provide solid advice.</p><p>Bankman-Fried’s lawyers told the court the advice he received from legal advisers was “relevant to rebut” the government’s argument that he acted with criminal intent.</p><p>Within days of FTX’s failure ,Ellison, who led Bankman-Fried’s ostensibly separate crypto hedge fund, had signed a guilty plea agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>In July, the New York Times published excerpts from her private diaries, which a judge decided had likely been leaked by Bankman-Fried to “frighten” her.</p><p>After the leak, Bankman-Fried was returned to prison and his $250m bail revoked. Since then the former crypto prodigy has waited behind bars for his trial to begin.</p><p>For the prosecution, evidence related to Ellison could be crucial to proving “criminal conspiracy”, according to a court filing. Days before FTX failed, Ellison addressed staff.</p><p>Asked who had authorised taking money from FTX customers to fund its high-risk hedge fund, Ellison said: “Um… Sam I guess.”</p><p>Should he be found guilty, Bankman-Fried could sentenced to 115 years in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJqlqLavsdKsZmtoYmh8cnyOaWhoq5GieqOtzaSkmqZdm7%2BqscNmna2wXZu%2FosHDZquroZGheqO4wKacZqSRrMamvtJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
