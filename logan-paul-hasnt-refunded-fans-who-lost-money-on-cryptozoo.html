YouTube star, boxer and wrestler Logan Paul is no stranger to controversy.
He’s promoted alleged UFO videos and the questionable energy drink Prime — which NY Sen. Chuck Schumer is now calling on the FDA to investigate. He once posted video showing a dead body in Japan’s Aokigahara “suicide forest” and drew the ire of PETA after videos showed him tasering two dead rats and performing “CPR” on a koi fish."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The rarer the animal, the higher the daily yield of in-game currency —&nbsp;Zoo tokens — earned.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Among Paul’s controversies: promoting the energy drink Prime.

In December of 2022, he published a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three-part series</a> on YouTube, alleging the many ways in which the NFT project had failed its investors and interviewing dozens of individuals who claimed to have lost money.</p><p>One of the worst affected individuals was an Australian, who lost close to $335,000 (USD). He asked that his name not be used out of fear of retaliation.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Stephen “Coffeezilla” Findeisen (above) has called out Paul as a scammer, in a YouTube series and on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. <span class=credit>@coffeebreak_YT/Twitter</span></figure><p>Findeisen’s videos went viral. In March, he appeared on the “Joe Rogan Experience,” one of the biggest podcasts in the world, to discuss his findings.</p><p>To date, Findeisen told The Post, <a href=#>not one investor has been compensated</a>. (Paul stated in his January video that he had apologized to Findeisen, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after accusing</a> the investigative reporter of using his name for “views and money” and publishing “a defamatory hit piece,” in response to Findeisen’s YouTube series. Paul also said that suing Findeisen “would not help CryptoZoo holders.”)</p><p>He estimates that “tens of thousands” of victims exist. According to Findeisen, who has close to 3 million subscribers on YouTube, Paul owes more than $3.6 million to investors.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zach Kelling</a>, Crypto Zoo’s chief engineer, told The Post that Paul owes him “at least $1 million” for his work.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In January, Paul laid out a recovery plan for CryptoZoo, including refunding “disappointed players.” But reports say that still hasn’t happened, six months later. <span class=credit>@LoganPaul/Twitter</span></figure><p>“Logan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doxxed me in January</a> in a very public attack video on YouTube, blaming me for his project failing after he refused to pay my team and black-listing all of our tokens,” Kelling said. “This lead to death threats and put my family’s life in jeopardy …</p><p>“Although [Paul] has since taken down the attack video, my unfortunate relationship to the project as a developer has caused massive issues for me in my life and career,” added Kelling, a Kansas&nbsp;City native. “I deeply regret ever trying to help him or his team.”</p><p>Findeisen invited The Post into a Discord group consisting solely of CryptoZoo victims —&nbsp;all of whom asked that their names not be published out of fear of retaliation.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Zach Kelling (above), Crypto Zoo’s chief engineer, told The Post that Paul owes him “at least $1 million” for his work. <span class=credit>@Zach Kelling/Facebook</span></figure><p>One member, who goes by the username “cptdandan,” claimed that he lost $110,000. Another victim said that “a refund is not enough. But if that’s the most that will happen. then it is at least something. My wish for Logan Paul would be for some jail time but that will never happen.”</p><p>At the very least, he concluded, “some sort of government action is needed.” (To date, no government regulators have accused Paul of any criminal conduct in connection with CryptoZoo.)</p><p>A third disgruntled commenter called Paul’s behavior “deplorable,” adding: The fact he just tries to hide and hope it goes away is the worst. He made a mistake —&nbsp;he needs to own it and do the right thing.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In addition to being a member of WWE, Paul takes part in high-profile boxing matches. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Another investor, who claims to have lost $15,000, “would like Paul to take a good hard look at himself” and ask “if he truly thinks his family would be proud of a serial scammer who can’t man up enough to do the right thing.”</p><p>Paul did not reply to requests for comment.</p><p>Findeisen also has a message for Paul: “If you make big promises, you have to deliver. Scamming your fans is not acceptable.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Model Nina Agdal recently said yes to Paul’s marriage proposal. <span class=credit>Logan Paul / Instagram</span></figure><p>“My personal opinion is that CryptoZoo was a fraud, but I will leave it to law enforcement to decide if there should be further steps taken,” the 37-year-old said. “As it is, Logan Paul is being sued by his own former fans, and I think that speaks volumes about the damage he’s done to others and to his own reputation.”</p><p>Findeisen promises that he “won’t stop trying to help the victims get their money back. Logan Paul promised he’d refund them, it’s time to pay up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamxfobyorc1mp5qtnGK1or%2FNrWSrnZaqu6Wxw2admqajYsSpu4ylpqysXaK8r7HYZqanZZOnxrHAzrOmqGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
