The comparisons don’t bother her one bit.</p><p id=eiWRdHsh8Oo data-wc=8><strong>VIDEO: Watch Malaika on her HFM cover shoot</strong></p><p id=eqcRpnmVn-c data-wc=49>"It's such a nice feeling to be put in a place that&nbsp;people say: 'Naomi did it before you'. That’s an uplift. I've met her and she is really lovely. She'll come&nbsp;backstage [at fashion shows] and scream the girls'&nbsp;names like 'Malaika', kind of pushing us all along."</p><p id=eFMvbav0DTj data-wc=2><strong>FIND OUT: <a class=hm-link href=#>The workout Naomi Campbell swears by</a></strong></p><p id=e0H5p86DKKOf data-wc=58>Continuing to go from strength-to-strength in 2013 she was chosen by <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria's Secret</a> – a highlight for any model, "When they picked me I was&nbsp;ecstatic, I remember praying to God&nbsp;and saying, 'Thank-you for this'. It was a fun show&nbsp;everyone laughs&nbsp;and giggles backstage - I loved seeing all the big girls like Adriana [Lima] and Candice&nbsp;[Swanepoel]."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9f6b86da28ec-malaika-firth-cover-z.jpg><p id=eb68oOPnm8SU data-wc=1><strong>WATCH: <a class=hm-link href=#>Adriana Lima's epic final walk for Victoria's Secret</a></strong></p><p id=ePsZND3cSZ0H data-wc=36>Then, the following season she walked in over 40 shows including Kenzo, Bottega Veneta, Marc Jacobs and Jean Paul Gautier.&nbsp;However, it was around this time that&nbsp;the heady height of success began to turn negative.</p><p id=e9gveQmZ3DTu data-wc=66>"I started going through some bad stuff,"&nbsp;she says reflecting on a time in her life when everything was turned upside down and her mental health began to suffer. "All these good jobs would be coming to me and my agency would be really supportive in different ways, but I wasn't in the right mindset,"&nbsp;she says of when she took some time out from modelling.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd7cd9ac7ee9-malaika-firth-close-up-z.jpg><p id=ePQdLqJomqBV data-wc=83>But now she's back stronger and busier than ever, with even some of her family members having a go at modelling. This year she shot Fashion Targets Breast Cancer campaign with her mum Jecinter, and last year she appeared in a magazine alongside her 16-year-old brother Christian. "He loved it as he wants to do everything I do, I’m like a role model,"&nbsp;she smiles. "He really loved the modelling gig, he’s like: 'I want to be like you, I’m going be famous'."</p><p id=ea8lHuzw94pd data-wc=20><strong>To read the interview and see our exclusive shoot pick up the June edition of Hello!
