The “Christmas Tree Farm” singer, 33, was spotted getting cozy at a bar with her boyfriend, 34, in Missouri following the Chiefs loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. The football upset didn’t deter the couple from celebrating the holidays with friends and fans.
“Got a new friendship bracelet this weekend 🏈,” Tanner Corum wrote via Instagram on Monday, December 11, after meeting Swift, referring to the musician’s Eras Tour bracelets that fans give one another."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Swift wore all black, including a long-sleeved shirt and leather skirt while Kelce donned a green and brown plaid jacket and green beanie.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The tight end had a smirk on his face as he <a href=#>held onto Swift</a> when the picture was captured. Kelce wrapped his arm around his girlfriend’s waist in the photo as Swift closed her eyes and went in for the kiss.</p><p>Scroll down for more photos of Swift and Kelce’s <a href=#>holiday-filled outing</a> on Sunday:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1edOrmK%2Bho2K4prjCnmSsoJGnsm63yKyqZpmkYrCpvsisq6aZo2Kvor6MoqVmo5GjwKK%2FjJygrbFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
