Police say they have informed his next of kin and that there haven't yet been any arrests.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Kelly Allen said: “Although we are at the early stage of our investigation, we know that the suspect forced his way into the victim’s home and stabbed him a number of times before leaving the scene on foot to Park Grove and from there towards Chad Green. The suspect was a black male dressed in all black clothing."</p><p><b>READ MORE: <span><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=live-event>Newham murder: Man, 20, found stabbed to death in East London home</a></span></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article23733957.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Plaistow3.jpg><p>Residents are frightened by how frequent these incidents are becoming. One local, who chose to remain anonymous, told <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>MyLondon's</a> reporter at the scene: "It's terrible. This is the third in three years in this area. People don't like to talk because they're scared of reprisals."</p><p>Local resident Lizah, 66, said: "I've lived here for 15 years. There are a lot of bad things going on here, I see blue lights and I just check my doors are locked and pray to God. It's sad, very very sad. I don't know the boy who died but here we're all family and it feels like we all lose a son."</p><p>Another local man, 34, added: "I don't really know much other than a guy was murdered, but it's disturbing - it's shocking to have that happen so close to you in such a nice area."</p><p>A local community support officer, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "I've lost count of the amount of stabbings that have happened in Newham recently." He added that the situation in the Borough is getting 'worse and worse'.</p><p>Mum of three, 30-year-old Tash, who has lived on the estate for over five years said: "I didn't see what happened as I was at work yesterday, I just can't wrap my head around it [...] I hope they catch the guy, it feels like things are getting worse around here every month, or every week even, with another fight or knives around or something."</p><p>Some residents are so affected that they are considering moving away. Mary Dean, 71, told MyLondon that she tries not to leave the house "unless I have to".</p><p>"I feel intimidated quite easily as there's so much noise and I do find it scary, I really do," she said. "I've been trying to organise a move for myself for a long time but it's so hard and there aren't many places. This is what I can get at the moment so I'll stick it out, but you hear of murders like this, especially forcing your way into someone's house. It doesn't make me feel any better, I won't lie."</p><p>Others are telling their children to use main roads on their way to school. Luliana, 39, said: “I tell my son when he goes to school only to go down the main roads where he can see people.”</p><p><b>Do you have a story you think we should be covering?
