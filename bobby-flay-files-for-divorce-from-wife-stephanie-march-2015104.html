Celebrity chef Bobby Flay has filed for divorce from his wife Stephanie March. The news comes just one day after Us Weekly confirmed that the couple split several weeks ago.
According to TMZ, Flay cited that their 10-year marriage has &#34;broken down irretrievably.&#34; The exes signed a prenup, which March is reportedly not so keen about.
Possible signs of a breakup surfaced this past February. As one insider told Us, Flay, 50, attended the Food & Wine Festival in Florida instead of celebrating the couple's 10th wedding anniversary."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As one insider told Us, Flay, 50, attended the Food & Wine Festival in Florida instead of celebrating the couple's 10th wedding anniversary.</p><p>Flay and the actress — who wed in February 2005 — revealed during Rachael Ray's show in April 2012 how they first met. "I was working on this show, Law & Order SVU, and two of our dear friends <strong>Mariska [Hargitay] </strong>— and your best friend growing up, one of the cameramen, they conspired to introduce us and I didn’t want to go," March recalled.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Flay butted in, explaining that he called Hargitay to help set things up. "I was like, 'I wanted to ask you about this girl who just started working on your show.' So two days later Mariska called me and said, 'I spoke to Stephanie, she doesn’t want to go out with you.' And I said, 'Why, what did I do to her?'"</p><p>March teased that she initially thought he had a terrible reputation. She also gushed that the first meal he ever made her was breakfast. "He said what do you like on your toast and I said butter and honey," she said, "it was beautiful."</p><p>The exes have no children together, but March is stepmom to Flay's 18-year-old daughter Sophie, whom he shares with his second ex-wife Kate Connelly. Flay was also previously married to Debra Ponzek for two years in the early '90s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmompKueqe4wLJkn6GcmsBuss6rZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMn6mopV2stqexjKyrnqiYlruqsYymmKubmGJ6c3yQbmhpbA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
