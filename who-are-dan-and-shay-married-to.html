The two got married the following May and celebrated their fifth anniversary this year.</p><p>For the couple, the time between the engagement and the wedding six months later did feel rushed at all.</p><p>"Everybody’s story is different, everybody’s timeline is different," Dan told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "By the time we got engaged, we were so familiar with each other that there wasn’t anything foreign or scary."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dan and Abby share an affection for animals. In fact, they initially met at an animal rescue center. Both are vegetarians, and they still spend much of their free time working with animal rescues. They even included the Nashville-area <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 12:10 Animal Rescue</a> in their wedding registry so that guests could donate instead of giving them a gift.</p><p>While the couple don't have any children, they do have four adorable fur babies named Chief, Ghost, Joy, and Mac.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shay Mooney is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also married</a>. He met his wife, Hannah Billingsley, through mutual friends, and they chatted inconsistently for the first few years. They started dating in earnest in 2015 and were married two years later. Today, they share two sons, Asher (5) and Ames (2). On Aug. 12, 2022, they also announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah is pregnant with baby No. 3</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Dan and Shay brothers?</h2><p>Although Dan and Shay may seem close now, they aren't brothers, or even life-long friends. Both were already working in country music when they got together. Shay was a solo artist, while Dan was part of a band called Bonaventure. They met in December of 2012 and began working on music together almost immediately. Within months, they had multiple signing offers, and the rest is history.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is who in Dan + Shay?</h2><p>Dan and Shay may not be brothers, but they look enough alike that even fans can have trouble telling them apart. In the video above, in which the duo performs an emo song they wrote just for fun, Dan is on the left, and Shay is on the right. At the moment, Dan has longer hair, although it's tied back in a bun in the video.</p><p>They may not be actually siblings, but it's clear that the bond between Dan and Shay is pretty intense. They've been together for a decade, and they've found enormous success by relying on one another as music partners and friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecCrnGackaN6orrDZqqhmaliuqK%2B0aKcnWWkpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
