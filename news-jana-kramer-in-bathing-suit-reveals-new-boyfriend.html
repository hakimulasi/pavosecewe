The singer and actress, who finalized her divorce from third husband Mike Caussin over the summer, introduced her new boyfriend on social media Tuesday: Ian Schinelli, reportedly a former Navy SEAL. "Sometimes you just have to stop fighting it and listen to your heart. I don't know what the future holds and honestly who does… Everyday I continue to heal and I know there is still lots of work to do, but damn it feels really nice to find happiness along the way," she wrote in the post. "To find someone who doesn't look at your scars as a challenge or problem but rather helps you hold them and stands there to encourage you with love, strength and empathy along the way," she concluded, tagging her new man Ian who goes by the Instagram handle </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@officially_mr_e</span></a><span>. In the photos, the duo look loved up in a variety of places and in one of them, Kramer shows off her phenomenal figure. How does the actress and country singer keep herself so fit?

"Because when I look at this photo, I see strength. If I'm honest, I lost a little too much weight after my divorce, and I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the number I saw. But that's an unhealthy way to look at it. It should never be about the number. It should be about how you feel," she wrote in a recent Instagram post. "I have been actively becoming strong again for me. I look at this pic now and I'm proud of myself for the hard work and commitment to loving myself. This body made two beautiful humans. I'm proud of my body. …And I want to encourage you to do what makes you happy too… move the way you want to move… show off what you are proud of… feel your strength. And be proud of YOU, no matter what shape or size you are."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1358490087.jpg><p><span>Jana is one of the many stars who train with Nashville based fitness pro Erin Oprea. Jana often shares clips from her workouts via her Instagram stories. When at home she uses Oprea's Pretty Muscles app workouts. "I work out with Erin two times a week," she explained in an Instagram story. The duo do "a ton of squats, sumo squats, lunges."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1149910846.jpg><p><span>Jana loves running, on the treadmill and outside. "I hated running and now I love it," she confessed. "It's helped me lean out." "Being active and engaging in regular aerobic exercise is important for overall heart health and wellness. Typically, 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity five days a week is recommended for most healthy adults. Running is a simple, low-cost exercise, and you should be commended for starting a new exercise regimen," reports the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/shutterstock_1901482834.jpg><p><span>"I personally think everything in moderation," Jana said about her diet. "I had a chocolate chip cookie last night. I will eat another one tonight. I don't think you should deprive yourself of anything. I think, eat when you are hungry. But all-around diet is how I do it."&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Jana focuses on the mental health benefits of exercise as much as the physical. "Still not feeling 100 percent," she explained in a recent Instagram story. "But I'm still going to run it out, sweat it out." She previously told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Us Weekly</span></a><span> that exercise helps her keep sane. "Working out for me is my sanity…Even just going for a walk, that is a place where I come back and I'm like, 'I feel good, I feel balanced. Working out is 100% how I stay level."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko5melnqsvsCmnKtlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKucr52RocBuusSwZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
