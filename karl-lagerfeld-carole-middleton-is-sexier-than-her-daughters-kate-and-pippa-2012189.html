Now Chanel's notoriously outspoken creative director is focusing his attention on another Middleton: Pippa and Kate's mother, Carole.
&#34;I think Carole is very sexy,&#34; Lagerfeld tells Grazia UK. (The Party Pieces co-owner, 57, and husband Michael are parents to Kate, 30, Pippa, 28, and James, 25). &#34;I think the mother is sexier than the daughters."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(The Party Pieces co-owner, 57, and husband Michael are parents to Kate, 30, Pippa, 28, and <strong>James</strong>, 25). "I think the mother is sexier than the daughters. There is something full of life about her. For a woman who must be 50 or so I think she's great. Full of energy."</p><p>During his chat with the mag, the eccentric, 78-year-old designer — who recently celebrated the launch of his cosmetics collaboration with Shu Uemura — also took the opportunity to clarify his comments about Carole's youngest daughter, Pippa. (He told The Sun earlier this year that he doesn't "like [Pippa's] face. She should only show her back.")</p><p>Lagerfeld says he only meant Pippa could use a bit of help with her cosmetics choices. "I didn't mean that!" he explains. "I only meant I don't think her makeup is right. She has a roundish face and round eyes and she should pick another makeup for the eyes."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Once Pippa gets the makeover he thinks she so desperately needs, Lagerfeld is eager to get his hands on another famous face: Duchess Kate herself.</p><p>"I love Kate Middleton!" he gushed. "She can try anything. For makeup, she has no limits!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaKheq2txp6pn52cmXqkrdGoo55lnZ6xpbjEraanZZmoerSx16Kcq2Wkna6veceeqWackaq0qcDEq6pmo5Gpsm6tzZ1kqaGgpa5ufo9qaWpwaWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
