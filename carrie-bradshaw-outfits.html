Played by <a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, the star of HBO's <a class=hm-link href=#>Sex And The City</a> is known for her incessant smoking and questionable taste in men, (any Aidan fans in the room?) but above all else, her lust-worthy wardrobe is one of the show's greatest assets. Costume designer Patricia Field showed off her keen eye, curating some truly remarkable outfits that will go down in fashion history.</p><p id=esq_RfbqNTDu data-wc=13><a class=hm-link href=#>Hello! Fashion</a><strong>&nbsp;shares Carrie Bradshaw'</strong><strong>s most stylish outfits and how to recreate them:</strong></p><h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Richard Tyler ruffle dress</strong></h2><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f5b68fd4b34a-carrie-bradshaw-richard-tyler-ruffle-dress-z.jpg></strong><p id=ev4onSZnKRs data-wc=78><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Carrie found herself taking an unexpected dip in season 3 – straight into Central Park's pond. Whereas we, on the other hand, found ourselves falling head over heels for her Richard Tyler Resort 2001 ruffle dress. Carrie would no doubt be pleased to know that clear mules are having a moment thanks to the Gen Z-adored Y2K trend, but if, like us, you're in the mood for a whimsical asymmetric midi, look no further than Philosophy Di Lorenzo.</p><p id=e9-tI518cVnZ data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>7 Carrie Bradshaw-style dresses you need in your life</a></strong></p><p id=eUeH4BbI4h7h data-wc=13><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Carrie Bradshaw's shoes: 7 iconic pairs that you need in your life</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4c34b2da6b10-loveshackfancy-dress.png><h2><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Dior newspaper dress</strong></h2><p id=eckwjyv40F1g data-wc=60>John Galliano's famed newspaper dress, from Dior's autumn/winter 2000 collection, made for the perfect apology outfit. While Carrie's attempt to absolve herself of guilt for having an affair with Big while he was married to Natasha didn't go down too well (ruining someone's lunch as well as their marriage is really not a vibe), at least she looked seriously stylish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0ec08b7266d9-dolls-kill-newspaper-dress.jpg><h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Dolce & Gabbana floral dress</strong></h2><p id=eLNHM4rVJn86 data-wc=99>It's not hard to see why the Kardashians are so obsessed with ultra-slinky Dolce & Gabbana dresses – Carrie, too, was bowled over by the incredible floral maxi that was dangled in front of her as she prepared to take part in a fashion show. Sadly, the story had a less happy ending when her dress was swapped for a bejewelled pair of knickers, and she stacked it on the runway. To add insult to injury, Heidi Klum famously stepped over her, prompting Carrie's BFF Stanford to exclaim: "Oh, my god, she's fashion roadkill!" Excruciating doesn't quite cut it.</p><h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Black circle skirt and fur coat</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4bb7292c3289-carrie-bradshaw-black-50s-halter-dress-z.jpg></strong><p id=e_FSc6tts0d0 data-wc=38><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Legendary designer Alber Elbaz was responsible for this stunning halter neck circle skirt worn by the character in a promotional shoot. In true Carrie style, she topped things off with some major har volume and extremely covetable shoes.</p><h2><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Slip skirt and bum bag</strong></h2><p id=eYssrkdSvq3Q data-wc=51>Hands down, one of Carrie's most killer outfits was her cropped black micro sweater and her knee-length slip skirt worn in season four, both from Prada's spring 2001 collection. Paired with her monogram Gucci bum bag, a relaxed side-pony and some incredible abs, our love for this look knows no bounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e194ea74e948-screenshot-2023-05-29-at-165434.jpg><h2><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Belted shirt dress</strong></h2><p id=eL5yu35ARiF7 data-wc=13>Big's oversized white shirt + a Hermès belt = sartorial perfection. Enough said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b4f168ab5f74-free-people-shirt.jpg><h2><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Pinstripe knickerbocker suit</strong></h2><p id=euNyLjb9DFpJ data-wc=32>Only Carrie Bradshaw could pull off Pirate chic in a pinstripe knickerbocker co-ord. Her striped extravaganza served us a masterclass in proportion. But the retro braces? We might give those a miss.</p><h2>8. Fur flamboyance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/948f989c77ec-carrie-bradshaw-fur-coat-over-pyjamas.jpg><p id=eTjdgvw08Pul data-wc=73>&nbsp;Carrie's fur coat will go down in SATC fashion history as one of the character's most adored pieces of outerwear. She wore the longline coat on numerous occasions, but most memorably threw it over her an unconventional pyjama ensemble on New Year's Eve so she could go and visit a lonely Miranda. A string of pearls, a diamanté bag, and white booties – we only wish our sleepwear game looked quite so glam.</p><h2>9. The waistcoat moment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2c284207e5e7-carrie-bradshaw-waistcoat-outfit.jpg><p id=ey6HODYPPd data-wc=48>For the show's entry into cinema, Carrie went for a super sharp tailoring moment and the look has been etched on our mind ever since. It's giving preppy elegance, and we love the three-piece layering that she's got going on. Time to bag a waistcoat of our own…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e83ab068ce00-raey-waistcoat.jpg><h2>10. The high drama skirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c8545ef6cd0c-carrie-bradshaw-tiered-skirt.jpg><p id=ey-Jp8nkxdQ data-wc=44>Understated is rarely part of Carrie's sartorial repertoire, and this look worn to meet her Russian artist boyfriend Aleksandr Petrovsky is a case in point. Comprised of a red draped top, multi-strand pearls and a voluminous tiered skirt, this look is unapologetically high impact.</p><h2>11. The plaid mini&nbsp;</h2><p id=ebOn8gI99g0b data-wc=44>So much to unpack here. From the micro-length plaid skirt and pom-pom hair tie to the string of pearls (a Carrie accessory classic) and socks-stilettos combo, this season four look has so much fashion content, and yet, the overall impact is a resounding success. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ff1800b8c2fd-plaid-skirt.jpg><h2>12. Smoking hot&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c10fccd01e8b-carrie-bradshaw-smoking-with-headscarf.jpg><p id=ec3DhmPvXach data-wc=67>No, this is not your official warning that Grandmacore is the trend du jour, instead Carrie's unconventional And Just Like That outfit was curated to help her manage her smoking habit. She had limited herself to just one cigarette a day but needed a way to prevent the tempting scent from lingering on her hair and fingers, hence the bright pink rubber gloves and several headscarves. Perfection.</p><h2>13. Snakeskin splendour&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3f60f6507e89-carrie-bradshaw-snake-mini.jpg><p id=e1ygB4yt4r0 data-wc=43>The spaghetti strap mini dress is a party classic - and we can't get enough of Carrie's ruched snakeskin version. Take a leaf out of her book and style yours with a curly half-up, half-down 'do, delicate pearl studs and a black clutch.</p><h2>14. Washerwoman chic&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/629f9db1360a-carrie-bradshaw-bandana.jpg><p id=edYUJhWy60 data-wc=51>Where to start? This look is certainly an acquired taste. The bandana is giving Tomato Girl summer, and the black visible bra beneath the airy, white cami is actually kind of a mood. Mesh shoes are actually bang on trend for <a class=hm-link href=#>SS23</a>, but the <a class=hm-link href=#>jorts</a>? We require a little more convincing...</p><h2>15. Mottled polo neck and mini skirt&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/706e7d1eb541-carrie-bradshaw-jumper-mini-skirt.jpg><p id=eJzxGAjzJ1o7 data-wc=48>The ever-tricky <a class=hm-link href=#>transitional dressing period</a> is just a stone's throw away, and there's no time to waste. Get your wardrobe in order and take your style cues from Carrie. Her mottled pink polo neck looks cosy and cool, and we love the <a class=hm-link href=#>boho</a>-esque mini for a free-spirited touch.</p><h2>16. The glitzy bandeau dress&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/822916c1489a-carrie-bradshaw-bandea-dress.jpg><p id=eePtAndziKRH data-wc=30>Strapless necklines are super noughties, and yet, we can't get enough. Carrie's rich red piece, embellished with black sequins, catches the light and echoes the lustrousness of her beaded clutch.&nbsp;</p><h2>17. The statement corsage&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c8d7dda9a48b-carrie-bradshaw-corsage.jpg><p id=eFbye6VcxEF data-wc=43>Corsages and rosettes are experiencing a major comeback for SS23, and Carrie deserves a round of applause for her continued commitment to the cause. Team yours with a minimalist tank top and a printed Dior Saddle under your arm to pay sartorial tribute.</p><h2>18. The slinky slip</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e890a730c895-carrie-bradshaw-white-slip.jpg><p id=ezcqkHDt1A- data-wc=26>Every occasion is a fashion opportunity, even if you're just lounging in bed. Seek a lace-trimmed slip, tousled hair and your own Mr Big to replicate.</p><p id=eVsYZrSIcWl_ data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
