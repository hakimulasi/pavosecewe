According to <i><a id=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/2023-11-01-sundowns-reach-first-continental-final-since-2016-beating-ahly-in-afl-semis/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimesLIVE</a></i>, Sundown’s strong defence prevented the Red Devils from converting any chances. The absence of key strikers Peter Shalulile and Lucas Ribeiro Costa, which <a href=#>Rulani Mokwena prayed for</a>, was notable.</p><p class=align-left>He ended up playing Themba Zwane as a false 9, while Gaston Sirino and Thapelo Maseko provided attacking support from the wings.</p><h2>Ronwen Williams makes mistakes</h2><p class=align-left>Goalkeeper Ronwen Williams almost cost the team on a few occasions when he tackled <a href=#>Bafana Bafana teammate Percy Tau</a>, awarding Al Ahly a penalty, which he saved. When Hussein El Shahat attempted to score, Abdelmounaim Boutoil tried to clear it, and it almost sailed past Williams, who could not save the shot. Luckily, the ball struck the crossbar, denying Al-Ahly a goal. Their defence going forward kept Al-Ahly at bay.</p><h2>Rival football fans praise Sundowns</h2><p class=align-left>Fans from other <a href=#>football clubs</a> in Mzansi on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> gave credit where it was due.</p><p class=align-left>Senzo Mazibuko said:</p>“Wel done, Masandawana.
