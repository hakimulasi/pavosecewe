Robbie Williams is one of the best-selling British artists of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide. He once set a world record when he sold 1.6 million concert tickets in a single day. In 2002, Robbie signed a $150 million contract with EMI. It was the largest contract in British music history. Robbie is also known for <a href=#>selling his Beverly Hills mansion to Drake in May 2022 for $70 million</a>. Robbie bought the home in 2015 for $32 million. Soon after closing that sale, Robbie paid $50 million for a mansion in Holmby Hills. Much more detail about Robbie's real estate purchases over the years can be found at the end of this article.</p><p>Williams first rose to fame in the early 1990s as a member of the boy band Take That, which was one of the most successful groups in British pop history at the time. However, it was his solo career, launched in 1996, that catapulted him to global stardom.</p><p>Williams's debut solo album, "Life thru a Lens," released in 1997, featured the hit single "Angels," a song that has since become his signature tune and a perennial favorite. The album marked the beginning of a solo career characterized by commercial success and critical acclaim. His follow-up albums, such as "I've Been Expecting You," "Sing When You're Winning," and "Escapology," produced chart-topping singles like "Millennium," "Rock DJ," and "Feel," showcasing his versatility as an artist.</p><p>Known for his blend of pop, rock, and dance music, Williams has received numerous awards, including multiple BRIT Awards, and has set records for his album sales and live performances. His 2006 album "Rudebox" marked a departure from his usual style, embracing more electronic and hip-hop influences, which demonstrated his willingness to experiment with different musical genres.</p><p>Apart from his music, Williams is known for his lively personality and has occasionally made headlines for his outspoken comments and personal life. He has also ventured into acting, albeit sporadically, with roles in films and television.</p><p>In 2010, Williams briefly rejoined Take That, leading to the album "Progress," which became one of the fastest-selling albums in UK chart history. This reunion tour rekindled nostalgia and showcased his enduring appeal.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165923 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Robbie-Williams.jpg alt="Robbie Williams" width=450 height=441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-165923 class=wp-caption-text>Ian Gavan/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Robert <a href=# title="Peter Williams Net Worth">Peter Williams</a> was born on February 13th of 1974 in Stoke-On-Trent, England. Raised by parents who ran a pub, Williams initially attended Catholic school before switching to dance school. During his school years, Williams performed in many musicals, including Oliver!</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>At the age of 16, Robbie Williams joined Take That. Initially, Williams had very little creative control over the group's music, although he sang lead vocals on a number of their singles. Soon enough, he was quarreling with the group's manager, Nigel Martin-Smith, over the rules he had to follow as a member of Take That. In addition, Robbie Williams was being exposed to drugs and alcohol from a young age as a result of being thrust into the music industry.</p><p>In 1994, Williams suffered a near-drug overdose at the age of 20. During this period, Robbie had completely given up on offering any creative input, as his ideas had been rejected again and again. He became completely disinterested in the group, showing up late (or not at all) for rehearsals and acting in a hostile manner towards other members of the group. Take That were concerned he wouldn't be reliable during their upcoming tour, so they essentially told him to leave the group.</p><p>Williams left Take That in 1995, and the group lasted about a year without him before they completely disbanded. Although Robbie Williams was immediately interested in starting a solo career, his contract with Take That proved to be troublesome. A clause stated that he couldn't release any solo material until after Take That officially disbanded, and he was forced to pay $200,000 in commission after being sued by Martin-Smith. In 1996, Williams finally managed to get out of his contract with Take That and sign a new record deal with Chrysalis Records.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303973 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Robbie-Williams-1.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 2288px) 100vw, 2288px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303973 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images)</p><p>Williams' solo career started strongly, and he released a cover of George Micheal's "Freedom." The single charted well in the UK and launched Robbie's solo career. In 1997, he released his debut album: Life thru a Lens. The album contained the smash hit "Angels," which remains his best-seller in the UK to this day. The track helped his debut album sell over 2.4 million.</p><p>Next, Williams released the album I've Been Expecting You in 1998. The album had a strong James Bond theme, and it included the single "Millenium." This was Williams' first number-one single on the UK charts. In 1999, he toured throughout the US and Canada to promote his new album and gain notoriety in the North American market.</p><p>Robbie Williams finally achieved international success with the release of Sing When You're Winning in 1999. Within just one week, the album was certified two times platinum. He then recorded Swing When You're Winning, which included covers of <a href=# title="Frank Sinatra Net Worth">Frank Sinatra</a> songs. However, Williams was still failing to make much of an impact in the US, and sales of this album Escapology were disappointing within America.</p><p>In 2006, Robbie went a different route with a new electro-pop album called Rudebox. Although the album sold well and achieved 2 times platinum status, it received poor reviews. In 2009, he released the album Reality Killed the Video Star. He made a strong effort to return to prominence during this period, appearing on X Factor to promote his new singles.</p><p>In 2012, he released another album called Take the Crown. This album contained the hit "Candy," which became Robbie's first number-one hit in many years. In 2013, he released the album Swing Both Ways. In 2018, Williams performed at the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup.</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Williams started dating <a href=#>Ayda Field</a>, an American actress. In 2010, they were wed. Over the course of their relationship, they have had four children.</p><h2 id=port-vale><strong>Port Vale</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Robbie Williams bought 260,000 pounds worth of shares in his favorite soccer club, Port Vale. This made him the largest shareholder and the de-facto owner of the club. However, the club experienced hard times over the next few years and went into administration. This meant that Williams essentially lost his entire initial investment.</p><h2 id=contracts><strong>Contracts</strong></h2><p>In 2002, Robbie Williams signed a landmark contract with EMI, one of the biggest record labels in the world, which was reported to be worth £80 million (approximately $150 million at the time). This deal was notable for being one of the largest music contracts in history at that point. The contract covered multiple albums and also included provisions for profit-sharing in various areas, including touring and merchandising.</p><p>However, while the deal was seen as a major coup for Williams, it also came at a time when the music industry was beginning to feel the impact of digital piracy and declining album sales. This context made the contract a significant gamble for EMI. The deal was widely discussed and analyzed in the media and within the music industry, highlighting the changing nature of record contracts and artist compensation in the early 21st century.</p><h2 id=real-estate-assets><strong>Real Estate Assets</strong></h2><p>Robbie owns an extensive real estate portfolio that includes mansions all over the world, most notably in England and Los Angeles.</p><p>In 2002, he purchased a property in Beverly Hills for $5.45 million when he was just starting to push his solo career in a new direction. In 2017, he sold off the property for just under $10 million.</p><p>In 2015 Robbie dropped $32 million for a new, much larger, Beverly Hills compound. This house has 25,000 square feet of living space, an 11-car garage, an orchard, and 22 bathrooms. In March 2022 it was reported that rapper <a href=# title="Drake Net Worth">Drake</a> had purchased this home from Robbie for $70 million.</p><p>In 2016, he spent $22 million on a London mansion that has 46 bedrooms. In July 2018, he spent $21 million on a Malibu mansion. He barely had time to enjoy the place before flipping it for $28 million, earning a profit of over $7 million in an insanely short amount of time.</p><p>In March 2022, a few weeks after closing his $70 million mansion sale to Drake, Robbie paid $49.5 million for a mansion in LA's Holmby Hills neighborhood. The 19,000 square-foot property sits on two acres</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46rppuamZp6uLXLpaCapaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
