The mansion, which is called&nbsp;Palazzo di Amore, is nothing short of stunning. It sits on 25 prime acres of Beverly Hills real estate and was meticulously designed by Mohammed Hadid (super model <a href=#>Gigi Hadid's</a> father). It features 12 bathrooms, 23 bedrooms, a ballroom that can accommodate 250 people, a spa, tennis courts, and much much more. The master bedroom alone is 5,000 square feet in size.</p><p>The bad news, is that if you wanted to buy Palazzo di Amore, you're gonna need <strong>VERY</strong> deep pockets. The good news is that as of today, you can buy it for <strong>$46 million</strong> less than the price tag was yesterday. And while that may seem like a pretty steep discount, even after dropping the price tag from <strong>$195 million</strong> to <strong>$149 million</strong>, it's&nbsp;still the most expensive home for sale in the United States right now, and at that price would set the record for the most expensive home ever sold in America.</p><p></p><p>The Palazzo&nbsp;has been put on&nbsp;market by rags-to-riches real estate mogul,&nbsp;<strong>Jeff Greene</strong>. Greene worked as a busboy at a hotel in Palm Beach to help pay his way through college, including business school. He began investing slowly, always keeping in mind his mother's motto "save your pennies, look for value, and never pay retail." Today, Jeff owns a real estate empire made up approximately 1,150 units in Palm Beach, Florida and 3500+ apartments in Los Angeles. This former busboy has a <a href=#>net worth of $3 billion</a>.</p><p>Should the property sell for the asking price of $149 million, it would beat the record for most expensive house ever sold in America by $2 million. As of this writing, the record for the most expensive house ever bought in the United States belongs to a hedge fund manager named&nbsp;<a href=# title="Barry Rosenstein Net Worth">Barry Rosenstein</a>. Mr. Rosenstein set the record when he purchased <a href=#>this mansion</a> in the Hamptons for <strong>$147 million,</strong> back in May, 2014. Rosenstein could afford the incredible property because he founded a&nbsp;hedge fund called&nbsp;Jana Partners that&nbsp;controls&nbsp;$8 billion in assets. That's a $4 billion increase since 2012. Rosenstein took home $140 million in salary and bonuses in 2012, $120 million in 2013, and an estimated $150 million in&nbsp;2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeVrb2mutKirZ5lnZa7tLXOp2SsmZyaeqK5xKugnJldn8K0wIygpq1lZGt6rrXLpaCopl2Ytaatz56paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
