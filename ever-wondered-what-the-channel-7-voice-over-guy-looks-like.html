If the answer’s yes, get ready to find out (If the answer’s no, do me a favour and just keep reading anyway).
It turns out his name is Matt Wills and he’s been the voice behind the promo for almost every single Channel 7 show (other than the news) for more than 10 years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For something like <i>Criminal Minds</i>, I’ll record a 30 second promo, a 20 second promo and a 10 second promo so it might take me 10 minutes to do it all.”</p><p>On most days, Wills spends about two hours in the recording booth with his work typically airing on TV a week later.</p><p>This means that he gets a sneak peek at some of the upcoming plot lines of Channel 7 shows which people “always” try to coax out of him.</p><p>“Most of the time I tell them they’ll just have to watch to find out,” said Wills.</p><p>“I have a niece who was at one time very obsessed with <i>Home and Away </i>and always wanted to know what was happening next”.</p><p>This constant hounding about popular TV shows is something that Wills and voice over artists from other TV networks often joke about when they catch up.</p><p>“Most of us are friends,” said Wills.</p><p>“We don’t have voiceover get-togethers as such but we often bump into each other. We’re all very nice and polite to one another because you never know when you might need that friendship,” he said while laughing.</p><p>Despite the fact most of us hear his voice almost every single day, Wills is completely unknown by the Australian public. He’s always heard but never seen.</p><p>“In all this time I think only one person has out of the blue said to me, ‘Gee, I recognise your voice, are you the guy from Channel 7?’ said Wills.</p><p>Perhaps that’ll change from now on, because it’s time to put a face to the voice. Here he is, the voice of Channel 7, Matt Wills:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e9OvZp6ulad6uLvNnZyrnZRixKmt02aroZ1dmLWius2eo2ZvXau8qq%2FEZqavnaJitLbFjKWmqKOjYrmqt8RopZ6vo2LAtbvRsmZwaWNmf6OxwJxwcW9jaIanso9sbZpqZ2d%2Bo4OPm2menQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
