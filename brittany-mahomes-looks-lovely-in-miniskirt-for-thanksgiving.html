Mahomes, for her part, rocked a tan turtleneck sweater and a leather miniskirt. She topped the look off with sheer black tights and knee-high leather boots.</p><p>For glam, she looked gorgeous with a natural foundation, soft contour, rosy cheeks, warm eyeshadow shades blended into her crease, long lashes and glossy lips. She parted her locks down the side and wore them straightened.</p><p>While Brittany got glammed up for the holiday, husband<strong> Patrick Mahomes</strong> opted for a more laid-back look. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, 28, sported a sleek black hoodie, maroon joggers and gray sneakers.</p><p>Their kids, meanwhile, looked adorable in festive outfits. Daughter <a href=#>Sterling</a>, 2, wore a brown long-sleeve tank top featuring a colorful turkey design and orange and brown plaid pants. Her curly hair was styled half-up-half-down and she went barefoot.</p><p>Son Bronze, 11 months, for his part, smiled in an orange graphic T-shirt featuring “Gobble Gobble Gobble” on it. He looked precious in turkey-printed pajama pants.</p><p>This isn’t the first fabulous outfit the family has rocked lately. Earlier this month, <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> tapped the Mahomes’ to pose in<a href=#> a new Skims campaign</a>. For the ad, the family matched each other in a number of cozy ensembles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brittany-Mahomes-Gets-Glammed-Up-for-Thanksgiving-2.jpg><p>First, they twinned in red and black flannel outfits. At the time, Brittany held Bronze in her arms while wearing a fuzzy robe and matching pants. Patrick sat next to her in a patterned hoodie and pajama pants while playfully tossing Sterling around. Sterling, for her part, looked as cute as ever in a onesie while Bronze wore a crewneck and sweatpants.</p><p>Elsewhere in the photoshoot, they all changed into black sets and smiled together. Brittanny slayed in a zip-up while lifting Sterling — who wore a soft onesie — onto her shoulders. Patrick beamed in a sweatshirt and joggers while holding Bronze on his shoulder.</p><p>At the time, the parents gushed about their experience working with Skims in a press release statement. “We loved shooting for Skims as a family and had the best time on set,” Brittany said. “The matching sets and prints are so adorable and cozy. Skims will be a staple for our entire family for the holidays and behind.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Patrick added, “This is our first campaign as a family, and shooting Skims all together was an awesome moment. I’m all about comfort, and these sets will be my go-to at home all season.”</p><p>Patrick and Brittany <a href=#>started dating in high school</a> and wed in March 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2FqsDTmqWyZZ2WtbC5xKxkpaefoMBuuM6vnKWxXZ67brnIp6Cso5mnwW6yzqtkraCRo7i0s8ivoKefXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
