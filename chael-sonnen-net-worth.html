Born on 3 April, 1997, Chael is currently a promoter of martial arts and wrestling and is also an entrepreneur. Previously, one of the major players and competitors in Ultimate Fighting Championship, he was active in this career from 1997 until 2014, when he bid goodbye to his seventeen years long professional career as a mixed martial artist.</p><p>A famous wrestler and mixed martial artist of his generation, how rich is Chael Sonnen at the present? As of 2015, sources estimate that Sonnen has accumulated a net worth of $9 million, most of his wealth having been amassed from his successful career as an athlete. He earned more than $150,000 for many of his wrestling games as well as mixed martial arts games as prize money, which has obviously been adding to his wealth.</p><h3>Chael Sonnen Net Worth $9 Million</h3><p>Born and raised in Oregon, Chael was educated at West Linn High School and went on to further his studies, initially at Brigham Young University before transferring to the University of Oregon – which enabled him to continue training – from where he graduated with a Bsc degree in sociology. Chael was inclined towards wrestling from a very young age. Starting when he was in high school, Sonnen began to train in boxing which led him to become more interested in wrestling and mixed martial arts. While at university, he managed to win a silver medal at the Greco-Roman World University Championships in 2000. Before long, Chael decided to build a career in mix ed martial arts and started playing professionally at the age of nineteen. His beginning became a sort of winning spree as he won his first six games which helped him garner a sufficient amount of a fanbase in such a narrow span of time.</p><p>His amazing start in mixed martial arts provided him with a chance to fight in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He played in the Light-Heavyweight category which extended until his retirement from the sport. During his fighting career, he also became a part of World Extreme Cage fighting as well as Bodog Fight. Given his passion and skill for the game, he became one of the highly recognized fighters in UFC. His professional involvement in mixed martial arts for a span of seventeen years has obviously been one of the major sources for his current net worth.</p><p>During his career, he played in a total of 44 major games of mixed martial arts, winning twenty-nine. He lost fourteen of them and played a draw in one. For his impressive games and sportsmanship, Chael has earned many reputable awards and titles including “UFC” twice, two “World MMA Awards” and one “Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award” among many others. However, there was considerable speculation that Sonnen retired because of problems with drug-testing.</p><p>After retiring from missed martial arts, Chael has been endeavoring different ventures. A licensed realtor in his hometown in Arizona, Chael Sonnen also enjoys being an analyst and promoter of wrestling. He has also been investing in different ventures like restaurants and is reportedly also willing to invest in WWE.</p><p>Religiously inclined towards catholicism, Sonnen married Brittany Smith in 2013, and the couple shares a new-born son – June 2015.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=13.811965811966><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chael Sonnen</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$9 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 15, 1976</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Milwaukie</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>185 lbs (84.1 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Martial Artist, Entrepreneur, Promoter, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of Oregon, West Linn High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Brittany Smith</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Blauna Dian Sonnen, Thero Stephen Sonnen</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Claudia Sonnen, Patrick Sonnen</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Chael Patrick Sonnen , The American Gangster , The People's Champ</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/ChaelSonnen</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/ChaelSonnen</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2086002</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>UFC 98, UFC 55, UFC 95: Sanchez vs. Stevenson, UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie, UFC 56: Full Force</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>World Extreme Cagefighting</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Wrestled at the University of Oregon.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Lyons Pride</td><td></td><td>announced</td><td>Chael Sonnen</td></tr><tr><td>Here Comes the Boom</td><td>2012</td><td></td><td>Arguing Fighter</td></tr><tr><td>UFC Tonight</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series Self</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Meet Dave</td><td>2008</td><td>uncredited</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Law & Order: Criminal Intent</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>James 'Jimbo' Duncan</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Stunts <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=stunts><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Meet Dave</td><td>2008</td><td>stunts: New York</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=30><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Apprentice</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself -
