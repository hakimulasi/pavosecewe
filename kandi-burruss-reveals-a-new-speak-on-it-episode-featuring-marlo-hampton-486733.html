I canâ€™t help with this Porsha Porsha Porsha,â€™ and a commenter said: â€˜Marlo was thirsty as hell to bring up the bolo situation. Thirsty to be heard and seen thirsty to have beef with anyone..â€™</p><p>Someone on YouTube said: â€˜Marlo made a great point about why Shamea chose not to be friends with her anymore. The only reason she still talks to Kenya is in case Porsha drops her she has other people to keep her on the show. She learned from the era of the frick and frack aliance.â€™</p><p>Another commenter posted this: â€˜Love how Kandi supports her friendsâ€¦. sheâ€™s taking care of Marlo here, giving her the opportunity to explain some stuff etc and giving us more insight into Marlo as a person. Love Marlo though, she honestly needs her own show or something if they wonâ€™t give her a peach, she seems like a lot of fun.
