The season 10 premiere of The Blacklist would coincide nicely with this. Doesn’t it seem like a great idea to combine two crime dramas into one? On Fridays, this has been a huge hit for CBS; if they can do it, so can NBC.</span></p><p><span>Season 5 of Magnum P.I. has begun filming. With so much lead time, the show can produce enough episodes to debut in January.</span></p><p><span>I was wondering how many episodes we could possibly get. Shows that air midseason typically has shorter run times. The plot of this show is not a secret to us. When NBC decided to save the show, it did so for 20 episodes spread across two seasons. So, there are ten episodes left in Season 5 of Magnum P.I.; a premiere in January would be fantastic so that the show may air all the way through to the spring.</span></p><p><span>Would you be interested in watching on Tuesdays, when New Amsterdam moves to a new time slot? NBC is considering eliminating that slot because of the difficulty it presents. It makes more sense to watch The Blacklist on Fridays.</span></p><h2><span>When CBS Canceled “Magnum P.I.,” NBC quickly stepped in to Renew the show for a Season 5</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/When-CBS-cancelled-Magnum-P.I.-NBC-quickly-stepped-in-to-renew-the-show-for-a-Season-5.jpg><p><span>After CBS decided to end the drama’s four-season run in May, NBC picked up “Magnum P.I.” for another two seasons.</span></p><p><span>According to<a href=# rel=noopener> Variety’s</a> sources, the network has acquired 20 new episodes of “Magnum P.I.,” with the potential for more, and plans to air them during Seasons 5 and 6.</span></p><p><span>Season 4 of the reimagining of the classic 1980s action series premiered on CBS in October.
