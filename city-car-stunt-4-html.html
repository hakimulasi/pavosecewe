You can then choose the free driving mode, where making stunts, jumping with the car, doing flips, drifts and other crazy stuff like that will get you points in return.</p><p>You can do the stunts by yourself or in the 2P mode, which is also true for the racing mode, where you will race against another real player, or against the computer. The tracks are filled with ramps and other stuff to do stunts from, but the main goal remains to reach the finish line first and cross it.</p><p>As for how the two drivers control their cars, Player 1 uses the arrow keys to drive and N for nitro, while Player 2 will use the W, A, S, D keys to drive and the T key for nitro. Good luck to you all, and we hope that you don't stop at this game, but keep having fun with the amazing free content we work hard to offer you!</p><h4>How to play?</h4><p>P1: arrows, N. P2: W, A, S, D, T.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3MnqqzmaBjsLC5jqCYpp1fZoN5gJJomqKsqWKwor6MrKuupqRigW%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
