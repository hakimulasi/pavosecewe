It’s always so nice to be able to celebrate your friends and family finding true love. We obviously love the party with the fancy food, free drinks and dancing too!</p><p>But before the big day rolls around, there’s something you’ll need to take care of first: buying a gift. You may need an extra one for a bridal shower as well, or maybe something small for an engagement party. Many couples will register for gifts, but when things start to sell out or nothing is in the right price range, you may need to think more creatively. We’re here to do that thinking for you. We’ve picked out some awesome wedding gift options including unique, traditional, luxurious, inexpensive and personalized picks!</p><h2>Our Top Pick</h2><h2>Traditional Wedding Gifts</h2><p>There are some traditional gifts that almost every couple is going to appreciate and want, such as the popular stand mixer above. Other strong traditional picks include items like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">air fryers</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cookware sets</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">comfy sheets</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">luggage sets</a>. It’s hard to go wrong with these types of items! Pieces for the home are always top picks, as the marrying couple is often moving into a new place together or looking to upgrade the pieces they’d originally brought over from their single lives. It’s all about new pieces that both people can, together, claim as theirs. All the more special if those pieces come from you!</p><h2>How Much to Spend and Wedding Gift Etiquette</h2><p>Of course, picking an item you think the couple will like is only the beginning. The real question is how much you should spend. It’s obviously up for debate and partially based on opinion and personal budget. The answer can change based on how close you are with the couple, if you’re traveling, if you’re actually able to attend, etc.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a>, the average amount a wedding guest will spend is $99, while family members often spend at least $127 and coworkers or distant friends usually spend between $50 and $75. You can always adjust accordingly if you’re spending a lot of money on travel or aren’t attending, spending slightly less on the gift itself. Don’t stress too much about it! There are no official rules. The newly-married couple will simply be happy to receive your gift.</p><p>And what if the marrying couple asks for no gifts? If you’d still like to get something in their honor, consider donating to a charity they care about. And remember to write a thoughtful card regardless of what your gift is (or isn’t)!</p><h2>Best Wedding Gift Ideas</h2><h4>Orrerfors Set of 2 Premier Champagne Glasses</h4><p><strong>Best for the Traditional Couple</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unique-wedding-gifts-champagne-glasses.jpg><p>This set of crystal champagne glasses is a gorgeous gift the couple can use again and again.
