Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ewan Mitchell’s real-life parents are unknown to outsiders as he has not disclosed any family details.</p><p>He plays Aemond, the younger son of King Viserys I and Queen Alicent Hightower, in the House of the Dragon. As the Prince of Westeros, Aemond was given a dragon egg, but the egg never hatched. So the Prince without a dragon suffered a prejudiced childhood where his brother made fun of him.</p><p>Aemond grew up with his older brother, who made fun of him, and Rhaenyra’s sons, often his rivals for the Iron Throne. His family on screen is well-defined and known to the public.</p><p>But the actor who plays the character, Mitchell, is like an unknown personality to the crowd. He is unavailable on social media and has not spoken about any facts about his parents or family. Hence, nothing regarding his mom and dad is known.</p><h2 id=ewan-mitchell-net-worth><span class=ez-toc-section id=ewan-mitchell-net-worth></span> Ewan Mitchell Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ewan Mitchell’s net worth is thought to be around $500,000.</p><p>Some online sites, such as Mashoor Media, report the actor to have a fortune worth $2 million, but there is no verified data. His primary source of income is his acting career, where he has made a credible name for himself. Although the actor is a particularly new name and face in public, Mitchell has a pretty long career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>He made his acting debut in 2015 with a short film, and his first significant role came in 2017 when he played the role of Billy Taylor in the TV series The Halcyon. Similarly, his other acting projects include The Last Kingdom, Trigger Point, and World On Fire. He portrayed the character of Osferth in The Last Kingdom for around five years before landing the part in House of the Dragon.</p><p>Hence, with an acting career of at least five years, we expect the man to have accumulated a decent wealth valued at around a couple hundred thousand. Nonetheless, the official verification regarding his fortune remains a mystery.</p><h2 id=how-old-is-ewan-mitchell><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-ewan-mitchell></span> How Old Is Ewan Mitchell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Discussing Ewan Mitchell’s age, he is 20 years old.</p><p>He was born on March 12, 2002, in England, as reported by Mixed Article.
