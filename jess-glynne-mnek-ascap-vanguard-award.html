To be recognized not only by the public but by your peers, by other songwriters, for the music you are making is so heartwarming. When I look at the names that have won these awards on both sides of the Atlantic, I can’t even believe that I have been put in such a category.”</p><p>MNEK added: “I am so grateful to have won this award. My first love and passion is music and writing songs, so to be recognized in this extraordinary way by my peers, friends and colleagues is simply incredible. I am honored and humbled by this wonderful accolade – It’s a really dope feeling!”</p><p>Jess Glynne burst onto the music scene in 2014 as a vocalist on Clean Bandit’s&nbsp;Grammy Award winning ‘Rather Be’.

Both artists are extremely unique British talents.”</p><p>He added: “Jess has reached a multigenerational demographic with her soulful pop music and inspired songwriting.
