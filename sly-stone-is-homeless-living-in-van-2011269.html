"I just do not want to return to a fixed home. I cannot stand being in one place. I must keep moving."</p><p>Four years ago, the icon (real name: Sylvester Stewart) resided in a sprawling "compound" in the Napa Valley featuring a vineyard and multiple cars out front. At the height of his fame, Stone lived in a 5,432-square foot Beverly Hills mansion that once belonged to<strong> John Phillips</strong> of the Mamas and the Papas.</p><p>But the eccentric, erratic artist succumbed to both drug addiction, money mismanagement and lavish spending habits; Stone has spent tens of thousands of dollars on elaborate cars and motorcycles, which he sometimes even gifted to friends.</p><p>After multiple arrests in the 1980s for cocaine possession, Stone performed in 1987, and vanished from the stage for 19 years. He reemerged in a bizarre Grammys tribute in 2006, when he shuffled off the stage mid-song. Increasingly paranoid over the years, he sued his manager of fraud in 2009, asking for $50 million in damages and stolen royalty payments.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite his housing situation, Stone is still recording music in his van via laptop.</p><p>"My music is a format that will encourage you to have a song you won't forget. That's why I got so much money, that there are so many people around, and that's why I am in court. Millions of dollars!" Stone told the Post.</p><p>"But now please tell everybody, please, to give me a job, play my music. I’m tired of all this s–t, man," he added. "I see all the guys playing those old songs. Let these guys know, like <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, let me come in, just let me come in and pay me if you like it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqlsV2owbC6xGagrGWYpLqmuMSsqmakmau2r7OMoqVmrpGjenN8kGppb3Ff</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
