They next went to study at Cottenham Village College and eventually ended up at Long Road Sixth Form College.</p><p>From Eve’s LinkedIn profile, we found that she studies at King’s College London. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Cambridgeshire Live</span></a> reported that Jess and her sister currently study at UCL, however this is unconfirmed. But both sisters clearly are brains and beauty!</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ALL ABOUT EVE</a>:</strong></span> Has Eve Gale had surgery? Before and after Instagram pics of Love Island 2020 star!</li></ul><h3>What is Jess looking for on Love Island?</h3><p>Both sisters are adamant that they will not squabble over the male Islanders while in the villa, however we don’t think that’s the case when you hear their types!</p><p>Jess described her ideal man as “someone who is confident, not cocky. Selfassured, kind and respectful and on the same intelligence level.”</p><p>Eve described her type in almost identical wording: “I want someone who is fun and confident, not shy. Quite ‘alpha male’. And I’d like a guy who is switched on.”</p><p>They also both claimed Anthony Joshua was their ideal man… so, thank goodness there are not confident boxers in the villa this year, or these two would have their own fistfight!</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SMARTY PANTS</a>:</strong></span> Meet Leanne Amaning: Miss Ghana to Uni of Nottingham and Love Island 2020</li></ul><h3>Bad relationships</h3><p>Jess is definitely not interested in anyone who isn’t 100% loyal.</p><p>Speaking about her previous relationships, Jess explained to ITV that she had been with deceitful boyfriends.</p><p>She explained:</p><p>I was seeing someone and it was going really well. Then I saw him on <a href=# data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link>Instagram</a> in photos with a girl. The caption said ‘A rare one, I love you’. They’d been to Dubai together and were proper tight. The dates with me meant he’d been cheating the whole time.</p><h3>Follow Jess Gale on Instagram</h3><p>Like her twin sister Eve, Jess already has a mega following on Instagram. She’s practically Insta famous already!</p><p>Jess posts all her best travel pics, selfies and party snaps to her 15,700 strong following. However, she’s only been posting since mid-2017, meaning not much is known about Jessica beyond the Influencer-type posts she presents.</p><p>Check out Jessica on Instagram&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>@jessicarosegale</span></a>.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNktHuAQSg/</p><p style=text-align:center>WATCH LOVE ISLAND EVERY WEEKNIGHT AND SUNDAY FROM JANUARY 12TH 2020</p><p style=text-align:center><strong><img decoding=async draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INSTAGRAM</a>&nbsp;</span><strong>AND&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FACEBOOK</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfma61tc2gZqWnppp6qr%2FLmqWdZ6edvG610mahnqujnrCiecaao55lnKTDpnnIrKOappRif3F%2Bj6xkr6GgYrWwv9OeqqxlkaOxbr7UrKqepJxitLO71KlkrqaZq7Kzv8itsGarpKqxprrT</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
