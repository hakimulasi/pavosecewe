They simply don’t clean up after themselves, despite the fact that she calls herself a “housewife,” and yet she gives him a pb&j for lunch,” the user entered.</p><p>Additionally, users criticized Lexi for allegedly lying a lot in her videos.</p><p>Someone wrote: “It’s just a collection of odd, little lies. That raises the question, “What is the purpose of that? “Why lie?”&nbsp;</p><p>She once asserted, for instance, that she was an only child, a granddaughter, and no cousins.</p><p>Then she claimed to have a single cousin, which is strange.</p><p>According to other users, she allegedly makes up the details of cleaning the camper and attending class.</p><p>Things became nasty when Lexi allegedly started circulating false information online regarding Hayden’s cousin Hayley Wertman.</p><p>Hayley and Lexi seemed to engage in physical contact. Additionally, a Reddit user going by the handle u/Pine apple-bra and claiming to be Hayley posted the following in the group: “If any of you would like some tea.
