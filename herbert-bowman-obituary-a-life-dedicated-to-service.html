His remarkable journey, spanning more than six decades on Capitol Hill, left an indelible mark on American history. Bertie Bowman’s life story, as chronicled in his autobiography “Step by Step,” is a powerful narrative of hope, aspiration, and achievement. Born in South Carolina, he harbored dreams of a different life, one “up the road” in the bustling city of Washington, D.C., far from his family’s farm. At the tender age of 13, his “fantasy became an obsession” after a chance encounter with the late Democratic Senator Burnet Maybank of South Carolina. This meeting planted the seeds of a future that would break barriers and make history.</p><p>Bertie’s journey from a young dreamer to a seasoned congressional staffer was a testament to his unwavering determination and perseverance. He started as a janitorial staff member on Capitol Hill, working tirelessly to ascend the ranks within the Senate. His autobiography paints a vivid picture of his climb, with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the most influential committees in Congress, serving as the pinnacle of his career. Joining as a clerk in the 1960s, Bertie Bowman was well on his way to making a significant impact on the nation’s political landscape. In 1990, Bertie announced his retirement from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. However, his dedication to public service and his commitment to the betterment of society were far from over. When Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, assumed the committee’s chair, he personally invited Bertie to return as his hearing coordinator. The depth of their relationship transcended political boundaries, with Bowman considering those who opposed civil rights legislation as friends. In response to C-Span’s inquiry about maintaining friendships with lawmakers who held opposing views on civil rights, Bowman remarked, “Anytime you have someone that’s going to do things for you or ready to help you when you’re in need and stick by, that’s one reason why I call them my friend.”</p><p>In the face of adversity and difference of opinion, Bertie Bowman demonstrated the power of kindness, loyalty, and the ability to find common ground. His ability to work alongside lawmakers who had opposing stances on civil rights legislation underscored his commitment to his role and the belief that unity and collaboration could lead to progress. Bertie Bowman’s impact was not confined to the walls of Congress; it reached beyond the hallowed chambers and into the lives of those he encountered. Former President Bill Clinton, who had the privilege of working under Bowman when he served as a messenger for Senator William Fulbright, remembered him fondly in a 2019 interview with CBS. Bowman was the only African American Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member at the time. Clinton described Bowman as “exactly the kind of person you’d want to take you under his wing if you’re a 20-year-old student just working your first job in Washington.”</p><p>In the foreword of Bowman’s autobiography, Clinton eloquently stated, “From his humble beginnings as a poor farm boy in the segregated South to his years as a junior member of the Senate janitorial staff to his tenure as hearing coordinator for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he epitomizes the kind of citizen that makes this country great.” Bertie Bowman’s story is the embodiment of the American dream, an inspiring journey that serves as a beacon of hope for generations to come. As we remember Herbert “Bertie” Bowman, we honor a life defined by dedication, resilience, and the belief in the power of unity and collaboration. His legacy will continue to inspire countless individuals who share his dream of a better, more equitable future for all. Bertie Bowman’s lifetime of service is a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit and the positive change that can be achieved through unwavering commitment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKCVp6%2BmvtNmmaivnZa7brvBoquumaKueqJ5y6KdnmWUmrGqr8CtnJ1lpKR6tLHRr6CcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
