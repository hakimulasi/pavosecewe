Courtney Love brought her daughter Frances Bean Cobain to the premiere of Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, on Tuesday, April 21, in Hollywood. The edgy twosome have made few red carpet appearances over the years, but presented a united front to memorialize the Nirvana rocker, who died in 1994. 
Love, 50, wore an alluring red gown with capped sleeves and a pleated hemline for the event. The Hole frontwoman, who was married to Kurt from 1992 to 1994, styled her blonde locks in a sleek updo with piecey bangs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Back in in 2001 at the Pearl Harbor Hawaii premiere, Love and Frances, who was just 8-years-old at the time, wore black dresses and sported matching bob hairstyles.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>They made another appearance together for the Style Awards in 2007, where Gianni and Donatella Versace received the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style award. The duo matched again with plunging slip dresses — Love sported a hunter green silk version and Frances went for understated elegance in black. &nbsp;</p><p>Though heavily influenced by her father, Frances admitted to having separate musical taste. “I don’t really like Nirvana that much,” she said in the April 23, 2015 issue of <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. “Sorry, promotional people, Universal. I’m more into Mercury Rev, Oasis, Brian Jonestown Massacre. The grunge scene is not what I’m interested in.”</p><p>Still, she believed her father and his group had some good hits. “Territorial Pissings,” from Nirvana’s 1991 album Nevermind, is “a f–king great song,” she said. “And ‘Dumb’ [on In Utero] — I cry every time I hear that song. It’s a stripped-down version of Kurt’s perception of himself — of himself on drugs, off drugs, feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGacp6Wnwa%2Bx2GajqK6VYrOzrc2cnKxlkpqur3nCqJmaoZ5isq%2B2zrJkmmWdpMGpsdFmm5qtl53Bpr6Mp6CgoKRif3F9lGtpbQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
