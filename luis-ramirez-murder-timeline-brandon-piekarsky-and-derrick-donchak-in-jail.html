Find out if the suspects are still in jail today and the murder timeline, all in this article.</strong>Luis Ramirez, a Mexican immigrant was beaten to death in July 2008.<p>Four football players from Shenandoah Valley High School Blue Devils met Ramirez who was walking with his fiancee’s younger sister and started taunting him with racial slurs.</p><p>All of them were intoxicated and things escalated quickly as they began beating Luiz ruthlessly, leaving him unconscious. Ramirez died days later due to the head injuries sustained.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=luis-ramirez-murder-timeline-what-happened-his-death-explained></span>Luis Ramirez Murder Timeline: What Happened? His Death Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Luis Ramirez was beaten to&nbsp;death&nbsp;in July 2008 just because of his racial profile. Four local footballers beat him to death while shouting racial slurs and threats.</p><p>After two days of the incident, Ramirez died from the injury to the head from the beating. The news of his death took over media in an instant as Latino communities all over the country condemned the unfortunate incident.</p><p>The anti-Latino hate crime was alarming at that time and the Hispanic community came together against the racial hate crime.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-brandon-piekarsky-colin-walsh-and-derrick-donchak-in-jail></span>Are Brandon Piekarsky, Colin Walsh, And Derrick Donchak In Jail?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>We are not sure if Brandon Piekrsky, Colin Walsh, and Derrick Donchak are still serving their time in jail or have been released.</p><p>It seems like the three men who were convicted while they were teenagers are out of jail. They were charged with a hate crime, third-degree murder, and two of them were&nbsp;sentenced&nbsp;to nine years in prison for the beating death of Luis Ramirez.</p><p>After massive protest from the Hispanic community, the case was again looked into and a few police officers were also charged for concealing the evidence and standing in the way of investigators. Further 23 months were added to their sentence, but since the incident took place in 2008, almost fourteen years have passed.</p><p>Therefore, we are not sure if they have been released or not. We hope to update more information as soon as possible.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-luiz-ramirez-family></span>Who Was Luiz Ramirez Family?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Luiz Ramirez was an immigrant from Mexico. He was living with his fiancee, Crystal Dillman, and was with her sister on the day of the incident.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have no details regarding his other family members. Most of his family members were back in Mexico and he was living illegally in the States.</p><p>Despite all the efforts to find his family details, we could not find anything about them. There is no information on Ramirez’s family on the web either.</p><p>We hope to update more information as soon as possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSlnsBuvsCmoKudqmK6tr7DnqlmrJmisq21zZ5km6qRo7GwuoypoJ6jkafArMWMmqWdZZSav7O1wqRknaeemLWit4yipWaikZ65cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
