In</p><p><strong>Shin-Soo Choo net worth and contract details</strong>: In 2014 Shin-Soo signed a 7-year $130 million contract with the Texas Rangers. He rejected a 7-year $140 million contract from the Yankees which actually would have paid him slightly less when state and city taxes are considered. By choosing a Texas team, Shin-Soo could earn an extra 10% on his contract compared to what he would have earned in New York. Using real numbers, under his Texas deal, Shin-Soo will likely make around $11 million per season after taxes. In New York, even with a slightly larger pre-tax paycheck his after-tax pay would have been $10 million. So over the course of the contract he'll keep an extra $7 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2irmJ67br%2FOqGScoJ%2Bkeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
