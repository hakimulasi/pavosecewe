In this way, teams, coaches, players and owners <strong>are joining the almost worldwide support for the Bills' second-year safety's health.</strong></p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Other leagues and sports join the support</h2><p>The NFL and its 32 teams were not the only ones to join in the support. Other teams, <strong>from other sports and other leagues have also shown their support for the Bills, Hamlin and his family.</strong></p><p>One such team is the NHL's Buffalo Sabres, whose players are supporting Hamlin by wearing white jerseys with the words "Love for 3" and the number 3 in red. <strong>Stars such as Russell Wilson, Ciara, Snoop Dog, MC Hammer and several others</strong> expressed their support for Hamlin and his family on their social networks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWdiZX90e49qZmlsX2uAo4DBn2puamJrfXKww2lqcnCSaYJ5sI2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
