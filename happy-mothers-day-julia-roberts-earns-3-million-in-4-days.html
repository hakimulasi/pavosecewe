Julia Roberts continues to command the title of one of Hollywood's highest-paid – after earning <strong>$3 million</strong> for her supporting role in the recently released film <i>Mother's Day</i>.</p><p>The romantic comedy directed by <a href=# title="Garry Marshall Net Worth">Garry Marshall</a> packs an all-star cast – including <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston Net Worth">Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=# title="Jason Sudeikis Net Worth">Jason Sudeikis</a> and <a href=# title="Kate Hudson Net Worth">Kate Hudson</a>. For her work on the film, Julia Roberts earned $3 million.</p><p>Roberts, who has a net worth of <a href=#>$250 million</a>, was only required to appear on the set for a total of four days during the production of <i>Mother's Day.</i> That works out $750,000 per day. The film follows three generations as they come together in the week leading up to the holiday it is named after.</p><p>Roberts found her footing in fame in the same genre, when she headlined romantic comedy <i>Pretty Woman,&nbsp;</i>in 1990, a role for which she was paid $300,000.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-195545 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-462239050.jpg alt="Frazer Harrison/Getty Images" width=900 height=613 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-195545 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p>Since then, Roberts has been no stranger to the highest-paid of Hollywood rosters.</p><p>Roberts was consistently ranked as the highest-paid actress in the world in the 1990s into the early 2000s. Her Oscar-winning role in <i><a href=# title="Erin Brockovich Net Worth">Erin Brockovich</a></i> earned her an impressive $20 million. To add to that, she was allegedly paid an unprecedented $25 million for her part in Mona Lisa Smile.</p><p>Roberts also appeared in Marshall's similarly-themed 2010 venture, <i>Valentine's Day, </i>earning another $3 million for only six minutes of screen time.</p><p>Additionally, her films dating from 1988's Mystic Pizza onward have collectively brought in more than $2.6 billion in box office receipts.</p><p>However, unlike Roberts' past roles in hits like Brockovich, her latest film isn't receiving the same critical – or financial – reception. <i>Mother's Day</i> opened with mixed-to-bad reviews and received only $8.3 million in ticket sales over the weekend.</p><p>With a less than stellar showing, Roberts' steep price tag, coupled with the salaries of the film's other A-list celebrities, may make for a not-so-happy <i>Mother's Day –&nbsp;</i>but not all is not lost. The upcoming Mother's Day weekend is likely to draw continuing interest in the film.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-195546 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-521019854.jpg alt="Kevin Winter/Getty Images" width=900 height=646 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-195546 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p>Additionally, Roberts' previous appearance in another Marshall film, <i>Valentine's Day</i>, helped pull in $110 million at the domestic box office in 2010. The surprise hit's success may very well be traced back to its A-list cast. Compare that to the movie's 2011 follow-up, <i>New Year's Eve,</i> which only made $55 million and didn't include Roberts.</p><p>While Roberts has only appeared in a handful of projects in recent years, fans have another big release to look forward to. <i>Money Monster</i>, which stars both Roberts and <a href=# title="George Clooney Net Worth">George Clooney</a>, premieres May 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmoZmgpcZuuc6tn56qo2KxosWMo6yloZFiv7CuxKurrGWVlr%2Bvv4xsZKahnKG2sLqMoqVmbF2Zrrq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
