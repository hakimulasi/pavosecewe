He currently plays for the prestigious La Liga club Real Madrid and represents the Turkey national team.</p><p>Güler began his youth career at Gençlerbirliği, an Ankara-based club, in 2014. In 2019, he joined the youth ranks of Fenerbahçe, one of Turkey’s prominent clubs. On January 13, 2021, Güler signed a two-and-a-half-year professional contract with Fenerbahçe, where he quickly gained recognition as a wonderkid and a promising prospect for the future.</p><p>During the 2021-22 season, Güler made his senior debut as a substitute player in a match against Finnish club HJK in the play-off round of the UEFA Europa League. He continued to impress, providing an assist in his first Süper Lig match just three days later. As the season progressed, Güler received more playing time and made history by becoming Fenerbahçe’s youngest goalscorer in Süper Lig history. His impressive performances caught the attention of several top European clubs, including Arsenal, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>On March 17, 2022, Fenerbahçe announced that they had secured Güler’s services with a three-year contract. In the following 2022-23 season, Güler was given the number 10 jersey, which holds special significance for Fenerbahçe fans as it was previously worn by club legend Alex de Souza. He started the season with a bang, scoring two goals in his first match against Kasımpaşa. He also scored his first goal in European competitions and provided an assist in a 2-0 away win over Dynamo Kyiv in the Europa League group stage.

Güler scored his first international goal for Turkey in a Euro 2024 qualifying match against Wales on June 19, 2023.</p><p>Arda Güler is a left-footed attacking midfielder known for his versatility. He can operate on the right wing, cutting inside to create shooting opportunities and deliver decisive passes to the final third. Güler possesses excellent set-piece abilities and is often referred to as the “Turkish Messi” by local media. He draws inspiration from Fenerbahçe legend Alex de Souza. In addition to his offensive contributions, Güler also makes valuable defensive contributions and can play as a pivotal player in central midfield.</p><p>As of June 11, 2023, Güler has made 32 appearances for Fenerbahçe, scoring 7 goals and providing 1 assist.
