However, his stay would be brief as the team waived Coles after nearly a month on August 29, 2010.</p><p>On September 21, 2010, Coles was talked about in the media as an option to fill in for <a href=#>Braylon Edwards</a>, who was charged with a DWI the previous night. Coles contemplated retirement.</p><p>On December 4, 2010, the Jets filled their open roster spot by signing Coles to yet another contract reuniting him with the Jets. The roster spot had been vacated when <a href=#>Jim Leonhard</a> was placed on injured reserve with a fractured tibia. Coles was able to rejoin the team in time for their Monday night game against the New England Patriots for Week 13 of the NFL's 2010 season.</p><p>Coles was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals on March 4, 2009. He would agree in principle to a four-year, $28 million contract.</p><p>After a disappointing season in 2005, Coles enjoyed a rebirth in 2006, directly due to the good health of quarterback, <a href=#>Chad Pennington</a>. On December 26, 2006, he caught the last touchdown on Monday Night Football's last game on ABC. Coles was released by the Jets on February 25, 2009.</p><p>He was traded back to the Jets in 2005 for <a href=#>Santana Moss</a>. During the first year of his second stint with the Jets, Coles revealed that he had been sexually abused between ages 10 to 13 by a man whom his mother, Sirretta married. Coles refused to divulge the man's name. After the abuse was revealed, Sirretta Coles divorced the man, who was later sentenced to nine years in prison. He served about a third of his sentence and was released. He was convicted of another crime and has been imprisoned since 2001 for it.</p><p>After a spectacular 2002 season, Coles signed with the Washington Redskins in the 2002 offseason and admitted that he left the Jets because the Redskins offered him more money. He made the Pro Bowl for the Redskins in 2003.</p><p>Coles was drafted by the New York Jets in the third round (78th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft. Coles' first career touchdown catch came in the Jets' "Monday Night Miracle" victory against the Miami Dolphins on October 23, 2000.</p><p>On September 29, 1999, during his senior season at Florida State, Coles and teammate <a href=#>Peter Warrick</a> went to a Tallahassee, Florida Dillard's department store and, with the aid of a cashier with whom they were friendly, purchased $412.38 worth of clothing and were charged only $21.40—a discount so large that it is considered shoplifting under Florida law. An off-duty officer saw the event through a surveillance camera, according to police. Coles, Warrick, and the clerk, were arrested for grand theft. On October 22, Coles pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petty theft and was dismissed from the Florida State Seminoles football team. At that year's rivalry game at the University of Florida, Florida Gators fans brought Dillard's bags to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium to mock the team. Florida State won the game, and Seminole fans returned the mocking by requesting the bags as souvenirs.</p><p>Coles's childhood nickname was "Trouble". Coles was arrested in 1998 for simple battery, suspended for the Seminoles' 1999 season opener versus Louisiana Tech for academic reasons, and was discovered to have accepted a plane ticket from a sports agent's representative in 1999.</p><p>Laveranues Leon Coles (/l ə ˈ v ɜːr n i ə s / ; born December 29, 1977) is a former American football wide receiver who played 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Florida State University. He was drafted by the New York Jets in the third round of the 2000 NFL Draft.
