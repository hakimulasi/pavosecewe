I mean, all the stuff about a relationship with Justin, I just was thinking back to that time. We were all sort of obsessed with that relationship. I remember them showing up at the MTV Awards <a href=#>with the denim on denim</a>,” the Jolliest Bunch author exclusively told Us Weekly. “I think there was a weird, sad nostalgia reading those passages.”</p><p>Timberlake, 42, was the subject of many of the book’s biggest revelations. Not only did Spears, 41, reveal that <a href=#>she got an abortion during their relationship</a> because Timberlake was not ready to become a father, but she also claimed that <a href=#>he cheated on her multiple times</a> and <a href=#>broke up with her via text</a>. A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> last month that Timberlake was “disappointed” that his ex decided to “air out their very personal, dirty laundry” in her book.</p><p>Pellegrino, for his part, joked that’s “never been a huge Dustin Timberwolf,” and prefers his ‘NSync bandmate <a href=#><strong>JC Chasez</strong></a>. “I love him so much,” the comedian, who even thanks Chasez in his book acknowledgments, added. “And I’m newly a <a href=#><strong>Joey Fatone</strong></a> fan.”</p><p>While on the subject of drama between exes, Pellegrino spoke about <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> star <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>’s split from ex <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>. News broke earlier this year that the former couple of nine years <a href=#>split after Sandoval, 40, cheated on Madix, 38</a>, with their Bravo costar <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. As teased in the show’s <a href=#>season 11 trailer</a>, the affair — which was subsequently dubbed <a href=#>“Scandoval”</a> — will be one of the season’s biggest story lines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Danny-Pellegrino-Thinks-NSync-Reunion-Was-PR-Stunt-for-Justin-Timberlake-2.jpg><p>“I’m very curious how they are going to edit [Tom] because <a href=#>he was the world’s biggest villain</a> last season,” Pellegrino, who cowrote <a href=#>the former couple’s cocktail book</a>, told Us. “And knowing Bravo the way that I do and you do, they always, the next season, usually, will edit them well, or it might take one more [season]. … [But you have to wonder], ‘Will they present him in a sympathetic way or will that come next season?’”</p><p>While Sandoval and Madix are in for a rocky season of Pump Rules, one celebrity couple staying out of drama is <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>. “I like it. I’m into it,” Pellegrino said of the duo’s <a href=#>new relationship</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Danny-Pellegrino-Thinks-NSync-Reunion-Was-PR-Stunt-for-Justin-Timberlake-3.jpg><p>He went on to dub himself “a new Swiftie” before gushing over his experience attending Swift’s <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>. “They must pump something in the air, in the oxygen, in those Era[s] Tour shows because I left there over the moon,” he joked. “I had the <a href=#>friendship bracelets</a> on. I was buying the merch. I waited in line for the merch for two hours. It was like, that’s where I’m at now. So, I’m happy with their happiness. I find [Travis] sexy, too.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hear more of Pellegrino’s Hollywood hot takes in the video above.
