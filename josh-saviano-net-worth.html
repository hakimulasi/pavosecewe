In 1988 he was cast in the comedy-drama television series “The Wonder Years”, to play the role of Kevin Arnold’s best friend, Paul Joshua Pfeiffer. The role earned him a decent level of recognition in the acting world, and it also greatly contributed to his net worth. He remained on the show until its cancellation in 1993.</p><p>Embracing the fame earned by his performance of Pfeiffer, Saviano went on to appear in other projects as well, both on the big and small screen, which further increased his popularity and improved his wealth.
