Lately, however, there's a new situation I'm dealing with. A third of my group first got interested in D&D because of Critical Role. I like Matt Mercer as much as the next guy, but these guys watched 30+ hours of the show before they ever picked up a D20. The Dwarf thinks that all Dwarves have Irish accents, and the Dragonborn sounds exactly like the one from the show (which is fine, until they meet NPCs that are played differently from how it's done on the show). I've been approached by half the group and asked how I planned to handle resurrection. When I told them I'd decide when we got there, they told me how Matt does it. Our WhatsApp is filled with Geek and Sundry videos about how to play RPG's better. There's nothing wrong with how they do it on the show, but I'm not Matt Mercer and they're not Vox Machina. At some point, the unrealistic expectations are going to clash with reality. How do you guys deal with players who've had past DM's they swear by?</span></p><p>TL;DR Critical Role has become the prototype for how my players think D&D works. How do I push my own way of doing things without letting them down?"</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.enworld.org/attachments/critical-role-matt-mercer-jpg.112190/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=Critical-Role-Matt-Mercer.jpg title=Critical-Role-Matt-Mercer.jpg width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>​</p><br>Here was the reply from Matthew Mercer:<p><span class=highlight>"Seeing stuff like this kinda breaks my heart. Regardless, the fact of the matter is our style of play is just that...our style of play. Every table is different, and should be! If they just want to “copy” what we do, that’s not very creative nor what makes the game magic at the table.</span></p><p>I DO believe that it’s important for any gaming group to discuss expectations early into a campaign so everyone can get on the same page and avoid dissonance. However, it’s EVERYONE’S responsibility at the table to provide and add to the experience for everyone to enjoy themselves and the story, not just the DM. As I saw some comments below mention, you want a particular style of game? That level of commitments rests on YOUR shoulders. Consolidate your style and wishes with those of the other players and DM, and somewhere in that unique mix you will find your table’s special style of storytelling.</p><p>Need I also remind your players that we are a table of professional actors, and I have been DMing for well over 20 years. We have spent our lives training in particular skills that allow us to get as immersed in the characters as we enjoy doing. Anyone can jump in as deeply, should they wish to, but EXPECTING that immediate level of comfort and interest is unfair and absurd. Do they want a deep, convoluted emotional journey like Scanlan? They better be able to bring it like Sam did. No? Then sit down and just have fun finding your own path. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.enworld.org/data:image/gif;base64 alt=;) title="Wink ;)" data-shortname=;) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>PLUS, our style isn’t for everyone! Hell, just scan the comments below to see how many folks don’t like us, haha. I’ve played with many different players, ran games of many different styles and focuses, and I can tell you... there is so much fun variety to how a TTRPG can be played, they’re limiting their chances to enjoy it by trying to “play it just like us”.</p><p>Anyway, I say the best course is have a very frank conversation with them about these things. Clearly say that your game will feel like YOUR game (meaning you and the players together), and it’s THEIR responsibility to bring to the table what facet they want to see in it. Show them this post, if it helps. In fact, show them this message:</p><p>“Guys. Relax. Your DM is kicking ass, and is doing this for YOUR enjoyment and journey. Appreciate that, listen, build with them, and make this something UNIQUE. Abandon expectations and just have fun together as friends.”</p><p>Anyway, so sorry. Things like this are never my intent. It’s a weird, wild west these days. Your gonna be great, friend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrWqKmlnF6kv6h706GpnpmUqHypu9Zmm6hlmWKvpq3TZquhnV2irrXAjKacq5uVp3qmssWemq1mZmuDcX2SaKean5VigA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
