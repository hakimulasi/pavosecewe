With sincerity in her voice, Kathy said, “I’m sorry. It wasn’t your fault. It was not your fault.” Her words resonated with the 54-year-old mother-of-four, who looked stunned and repeated Kathy’s reassurance, saying, “It’s not your fault. It was not your fault. I was just being sad.”</p><p>Kyle later reflected on this ‘cathartic’ moment during a 40-minute Amazon livestream, sharing how much Kathy’s apology meant to her. The Hollywood-born socialite explained, “It really meant a lot to me. We were kind of like laughing it off. So many people were watching us and filming us on their phones, but it actually meant a lot to me.”</p><p>The heartfelt exchange was a significant turning point for the sisters, who had stopped speaking after a tumultuous incident involving their former co-star, Lisa Rinna, in February 2022. Hilton had allegedly made derogatory remarks about Kyle, leading to their estrangement.</p><p>Prior conflicts between Kathy and Richards included the public outing of their sister Kim as an alcoholic in 2010, the professional rivalry when Mauricio Umansky left Hilton & Hyland for The Agency in 2011, and the fallout over Paramount Network’s 2018 series, “American Woman.”</p><p>In the midst of these personal developments, Kyle Richards has been busy filming the 13th season of her Bravo reality series, alongside fellow housewives Sutton Stracke, Garcelle Beauvais, Dorit Kemsley, Erika ‘Jayne’ Girardi, Crystal Kung Minkoff, and newcomer Annemarie Wiley.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kyle Richards and Kathy Hilton are the maternal half-sisters.
