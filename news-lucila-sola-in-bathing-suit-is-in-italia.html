The former flame of Al Pacino and mother of Camila Morrone shows her ex-boyfriend what he is missing in one of her latest social media posts, flaunting her incredible figure in a bathing suit. "Italia!!!" she captioned the Instagram snap. How does she stay so fit? Read on to see 6 ways Lucila Sola stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><p><span>Lucila enjoys paddle boarding. "When your friends catch you scrubbing your spray tan off," she joked in a caption of herself double-tasking on the paddleboard. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The American Council on Exercise</span></a><span> (ACE) agrees that paddle boarding is great for the core and also a great form of cardio. The water sport can burn an average of 385 calories for a 140 pound male and 436 for a female the same size, per a study conducted by Arizona State University.</span></p><p><span>Lucila stays fit on vacation by snorkling and swimming. Surprisingly, putting on a snorkel and fins and swimming through the water is a great workout. In addition to being a great aerobic exercise and burning calories, other health </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>benefits</span></a><span> may include improved cardiovascular function, stress reduction, mood enhancement, and muscular toning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lucila enjoys hiking – especially with her daughter. "Hiking is one of the best ways to get exercise. No matter what type of trail you find yourself on, hiking is a great whole-body workout—from head to toe and everything in between," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>National Parks Service</span></a><span>. Some of the physical benefits include building stronger muscles and bones, improving your sense of balance, improving your heart health, and decreasing the risk of certain respiratory problems. It also offers many mental health benefits, according to a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Stanford University</span></a><span> study.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lucila loves to read. "Best way to start the New Year," she captioned this photo. One </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard study</span></a><span> published in Social Science & Medicine found that people who read books regularly had a 20% lower risk of dying over the next 12 years compared with people who weren't readers or who read periodicals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lucila is an avid skier. "Mommy and Me Ski," she captioned a photo of herself on a trip with Camila. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Research</span></a><span> has linked downhill skiing to a number of health benefits. In addition to promoting physical fitness, it may decrease risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have also found that the more frequently a person skis, prevalence of known hypercholesterolemia, systemic hypertension, diabetes, the frequency of mental stress and the occurrence of memory deficits declines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lucila's drink of choice? Wine. "Red wine, in moderation, has long been thought of as heart healthy," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "The alcohol and certain substances in red wine called antioxidants may help prevent coronary artery disease, the condition that leads to heart attacks." While red wine is slightly healthier than white, the lighter shade of vino generally has fewer calories than the darker shade.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpa2TnrmiedKoo5plmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKKqZqGeYra1rcuimGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
