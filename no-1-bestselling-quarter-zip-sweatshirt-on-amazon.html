Time for pumpkin spice, leaf peeping and wrapping up in a variety of comfy, cozy outfits.

This oversized sweatshirt is made from 80% cotton and 20% rayon, making it super-soft, cozy and pleasantly stretchy for total, all-day comfort. It has a quarter-zip neck, which is handy for a variety of reasons — it adds visual interest, of course, instead of a plain crew neck; it allows a little extra looseness and comfort instead of a tight neckline; and, maybe best of all, it makes it easy to pull the sweatshirt on and off without messing up any sprayed-and-set hairstyles!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This sweatshirt</a> is ideal for lounging, working out or going about your day in comfy style. You can layer it over a lighter top underneath, or rock solo on less chilly days. The oversized fit makes it roomy at any size, and it’ll look great paired with jeans, leggings or even some bike shorts. Best of all, it comes in a variety of stylish autumnal colors, including light green, wine and coffee.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mirol Women’s 1/4 Zip Pullover Sweatshirt</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22</a> at Amazon now!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Despite being a pretty new offering, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hundreds of the Mirol pullover</a> have been sold just this month to those fashionistas obviously getting their wardrobes ready for the fall chill to set in.

I typically wear either a L or XL depending on the style. I ordered a L since it is made oversized and it fit perfectly. It’s nice and cozy and has some weight to it.” Another fan shared that its “perfect for cooler Arizona nights,” adding, “I really love this pullover sweatshirt. Fits well, since I like my tops oversized. It’s still a bit too warm to wear (still over 100 degrees this week in northern Arizona) but it will be perfect when it gets a little cooler.”</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">One commenter</a> noted that it does “[run] large even for an oversized sweatshirt” but that it is “excellent quality,” with another adding that it’s “Nice and soft” — “Great as a mid-layer or as a stand-alone on a cool day.
