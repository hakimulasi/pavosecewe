Perry admitted that workplace frustrations and a certain section of fans led to his character change.</p><p>“I certainly felt that it was time for a change, and I’ve kind of been waiting on that change for a while. And, honestly, a lot of it kind of grew through real frustrations that I guess I was having in the workplace, but also with certain wrestling fans.</p><p>I feel it’s kind of split down the middle. So, a lot of wrestling fans are the best fans you’ll ever find, and a lot of them are just very ungrateful and cynical, and kind of just looking for a reason to talk sh*t about people, and I felt like over time I’d been getting fed up.”</p><p>Perry was scheduled to retire the FTW Championship in AEW Dynamite this week, but the segment got postponed to AEW Collision this week. We’ll have to see how the segment will turn out in a few days.</p><p>What’s your view on this story? Do you like Jack Perry’s new character?
