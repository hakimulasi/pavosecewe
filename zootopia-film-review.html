It doesn’t even end there, Zootopia is the top box office showing ever for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film, Zootopia being the companies fifty-fourth.</p><p>The film’s official description via Disney is stated below.</p><p>“The modern mammal metropolis of Zootopia is a city like no other. Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it’s a melting pot where animals from every environment live together—a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when rookie Officer Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn’t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman), to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Zootopia,” a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard (“Tangled,” “Bolt”) and Rich Moore (“Wreck-It Ralph,” “The Simpsons”) and co-directed by Jared Bush (“Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero”), opens in theaters on March 4, 2016”.</p><p>So what is all the hype about? Another talking animal movie, yes, but not what you are use to. Zootopia was a fast paced, smart, comedy, with plot twists gallore that seemed more like a Pixar film. Several digs were made in the film to Disney, including the killer “Do you think that this is some cartoon musical where your insipid dreams come true? Well, let it go.” from Police Chief Bogo (Idris Elba) and a brief scene where a sneaky weasel is selling bootleg DVDs of very familiar titles, but with a Zootopia twist. It even had the slyest innuendo ever where Judy was producing a math problem and gushed of her species, “we’re good at multiplying”. The result was a very smart film that sneaked themes of sexism, racism, and following your dreams. We expect a Best Animated Picture Oscar coming to the land of Zootopia this time next year.</p><p>We also forever have the film’s official song “Try Everything” by Shakira stuck in our heads.<br></p><p>Have you seen Disney’s Zootopia; let us know @CelebMix of your own review!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kx7C706inopldm7atuYyrnK%2Bhlax8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
