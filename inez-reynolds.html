Blake Lively made her film debut at the age of ten. In 1998, her father directed the film ‘Sandman,’ in which she played a minor role. In 2005, she was cast as Bridget, one of the four female leads in the film ‘The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.’ She co-starred with Justin Long in the 2006 film ‘Accepted.’</p><p>Despite the fact that the film received negative reviews from critics.

She played the role for six seasons before the show was canceled in 2012.</p><p>In 2008, she was recast as Bridget in the sequel to ‘The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.’ Her performance earned her critics’ praise once more. She played the younger version of the main character in ‘The Private Lives of Pippa Lee’ (2009).</p><p>Despite her minor role, critics were taken aback by her “sensational” performance. In 2009, she also appeared in ‘New York, I Love You,’ a collection of eleven romantic short films directed by different people.</p><p>In 2010, she co-starred with Ben Affleck in the crime drama ‘The Town,’ which was based on Chuck Hogan’s novel ‘Prince of Thieves.’ Critics praised her performance as a young mother in the film.

In the 2012 film “Savages,” she took over the role of Ophelia “O” Sage from Jennifer Lawrence. Drew McWeeny of ‘HitFix,’ a film critic, praised her portrayal of a “broken, desperate little soul.”</p><p>She co-starred with Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford in the 2015 film ‘The Age of Adaline.’ Her most recent role was in the horror film ‘The Shallows,’ which received a positive critical response.</p><p>Ryan began his professional career in 1991.

In the same year, he appeared in the American television series Two Guys, a Girl, and Pizza Place.</p><p>He did, however, appear in a string of critically and commercially unsuccessful films for several years. He played a vampire hunter in Blade: Trinity in 2004 and the lead in The Amityville Horror in 2005. His film career took off in 2009, but he continued to thrive after appearing in the independent film Buried in 2010.</p><p>In 2011, he made a stunning return to the big screen. Then, in 2012, he demonstrated his comedic talents in The Change-Up. In 2013, he also provided voice work for the animated films The Croods and Turbo. He appeared in indie films such as The Voices in 2014.</p><p>In 2015, he appeared in the thriller Self/Less and had a small role in the film Woman in Gold. His year was greatly improved in 2016 when his labor of love, Deadpool, was finally released after years of development. The same year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2>Inez Reynolds Awards</h2><p>Inez has yet to be recognized.

She received National Board of Review and Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association awards as part of the ensemble cast.</p><p>In 2011, CinemaCon presented her with the ‘Breakthrough Performer of the Year Award.’ She was named one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential people the same year, and she also topped AskMen.com’s list of “most desirable” women.</p><p>Ryan, Inez’s father, received the Next Generation Male Award and the Man of the Year Award in 2003 and 2017, respectively.
