Since after this breakthrough appearance, Miller has kept the candle burning, appearing in several other works such as <i>Better Watch Out</i>, <i>Jasper Jones</i>, <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, and <i>American Exit</i>. While many are comfortable with knowing Levi for the various characters he portrays in films, fans are curious to get all the details about his career and off-the-screen life. To feed your curiosity, we have gathered all the bits of information you never knew about the young and budding actor. Here we go!</p><h2><strong>Things You Didn’t Know About Levi Miller</strong></h2><h4><strong>1. He made his professional debut at six</strong></h4><p>Levi Miller made his first screen appearance in 2010. Born as Levi Zane Miller on the 30th of September, 2002 in Queensland, Australia, he introduced himself to the filming industry with a win in a drama contest at the age of six. Before clocking eight, Miller played his debut screen role as Lavi in Akiva (2010).</p><h4><strong>2. He has featured in a number of failed movies</strong></h4><p>Following his role on Akiva, Levi Miller featured in A Heartbeat Away (2011), an Australian musical comedy film. Unfortunately, the film turned out a gross failure and box office flop, taking less than $120k against a $7m budget. It also received very poor critical response. Subsequent films such as Pan (2015) and A Wrinkle in Time (2018) were also not successful as each of them grossed below budget.</p><h4><strong>3. He had a two-year film dearth before his breakthrough</strong></h4><p>After playing Young Billy in the 2012 short film, Great Adventures, Levi got no film role until 2015 when he played the titular role in Pan, one that turned out his career breakthrough. Miller portrayed Peter Pan, a mischievous never-growing boy with flying abilities on the fantasy film which also starred Hugh Jackman and Garrett Hedlund. The same year, Levi also guest-starred on Supergirl, playing the minor role of Carter Grant in an episode of the CBS superhero series. He had earlier appeared in an episode of Fox’s 2011 Sci-fi series, Terra Nova.</p><h4><strong>4. Miller has shared the screen with Oprah Winfrey</strong></h4><p>2018 saw Miller play Calvin O’Keefe in the fantasy adventure movie, <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, getting an opportunity to share the screen with world-famous media personality, Oprah Winfrey. Prior to this, Levi featured as Luke in Better Watch Out. His excellent performance on the 2016 Christmas psychological horror movie earned him much critical acclaim. The same year, he starred as Mick on the well-received family comedy film, Red Dog: True Blue. For his ‘Mick’ role, Miller had to learn how to ride a motorcycle. In 2017, he played lead character Charlie Bucktin on Jasper Stones, an adaptation of the 2009 novel of same name. In 2019, he starred&nbsp;on the adventure thriller, <i>American Exit</i>. Miller would most likely play the lead in an upcoming Australian swim drama film, Streamline.</p><h4><strong>5. His mother quit her job for his career</strong></h4><p>Levi did not enjoy any of the fatherly love and privileges his fellow children get. The only son of his parents, he grew up with only his mother, Meg and sisters, Brittany and Tiarnee Miller. This is because Miller’s mother obtained a divorce from his father not long after his birth. She subsequently raised him single-handedly alongside his sisters, working as a nurse to meet the family expenses. However, following Levi’s breakthrough in the Australian filming industry, Meg abandoned her nursing job to enable her to give him all the support he would ever need.</p><h4><strong>6. His sisters inspired him into Modeling</strong></h4><p>In addition to acting, Levi Miller also works as a model. He started appearing in a number of television commercials as a child. This was after his sisters got their hooks on him with their modeling dreams, causing him to join them to auditions in order not to be left out. His good looks, garnished with blue eyes soon caught the attention of producers and the rest became history. Aside from this, Levi had no initial or personal interest in showbiz. Prominent among the brands he has so far posed for is Ralph Lauren. In the fall of 2015, he served as the ambassador for Lauren’s kid’s campaign, Polo.</p><h4><strong>7. Miller has garnered almost half-a-million followers on social media</strong></h4><p>Levi Miller is gradually gathering numerous fans to himself across the globe through his social media accounts. As of August 2019, Miller has gained a massive following of over 400k on the three major social media sites, namely: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. On Instagram, he has over 350k followers; on Facebook he has more than 61k; and on twitter, he has garnered over 18k.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BVYq%2BmwIyypq5llJ6xr8CMpKWor12ptaa%2FxGaroaGenMBurcGorK1lnJrDqnnMoqOlnaJif3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
