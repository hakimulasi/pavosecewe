(Both couples rocked festive onesies, according to social media pics shared by Brittany.)</p><p class=p1>Swift completed the South American leg of her <i>Eras Tour </i>last month before<a href=#> jetting off to visit Kelce in KC</a>. After a brief jaunt to London for <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé’</strong>s <i>Renaissance </i>documentary premiere</a> earlier this week, Swift returned to Missouri.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelce-Spotted-at-Holiday-Party-in-Kansas-City-In-Matching-Sweaters.jpg><p class=p1>Swift has been linked to Kelce since this summer after <a href=#>he attended her <i>Eras Tour </i>stop</a> at the Chief’s Arrowhead Stadium in July. While Kelce failed to meet Swift backstage and exchange phone numbers, she eventually got in touch after he recounted the tale on his “New Heights” podcast.</p><p class=p1>“There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: Yo! Did you know he was coming? I had somebody playing Cupid,” he<a href=#> told <i>.WSJ Magazine </i>in a November profile</a>. “She told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.”</p><p class=p1>The couple took their romance to the next level in September when<a href=#> she attended her first Chiefs game</a> against the Chicago Bears. Clad in team merch, Swift <a href=#>cheered on Kelce</a> alongside his mother, <strong>Donna</strong>. The Grammy winner has since attended three more of Kelce’s football games before he returned the favor, <a href=#>watching her <i>Eras </i>show in Argentina</a> in the VIP tent.</p><p class=p1>Despite busy career schedules, Swift and Kelce made “very detailed plans” to spend time together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Taylor and Travis have the next few months completely laid out,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told <i>Us </i></a>last month, noting they are in love. “They don’t want to start their relationship off with big gaps [in time spent apart].
