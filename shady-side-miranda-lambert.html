I was told country music is three chords and the truth."</p><p>Lambert chimed in, too: "High five on this babe. If you can't sing then don't. It's better to be honest than to pretend. I think it's bulls**t. My favorite performances were live live. The truth."</p><p>While honesty is good, Lambert's comments must have felt like a slap in the face to Brooks, who had previously given her a sweet shout-out backstage, telling press: "Let me tell you who fought the good fight tonight, in my opinion. Miranda Lambert. She is one of the few females that we play, so you think she'd want to play it safe. She stuck country music in all of our faces tonight. Traditional country music. So she's fighting the good fight."&nbsp;</p><p>That adds an extra layer of "ouch" to Lambert and East's needless commentary on Brooks' showmanship, don't you think?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphZn13e9KhmJ2xXai2pbGMpqCrmZ6Zrm64wKaZnqqkZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
