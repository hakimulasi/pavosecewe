On one end of the canvas, we have Bill practically crocheting “Daddy’s Little Girl” onto throw pillows for newfound daughter Luna’s room — never mind that she’s about as likely to actually be his kin as the OG Sally Spectra. And on the other end of the canvas, we have Hope dialing up the drama to well past its maximum capacity. It seems like only yesterday, she was dreaming about tearing stepbrother-in-law Finn’s clothes off, and now she’s mortified anew that her refusal to enter into an insta-marriage with Thomas has left Paris wearing his engagement ring — and not around her neck, either! Oh, and did we mention that someone is about to meet their maker?
