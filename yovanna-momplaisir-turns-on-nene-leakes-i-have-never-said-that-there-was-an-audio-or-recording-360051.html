If you’ve been keeping up with this story, you’d know that Yovanna Momplaisir has been named as the person who told Nene Leakes that Cynthia Bailey had been badmouthing her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I have never said that there was an audio or recording. I have never recorded anyone, that is not my character, that is not who I am. Just because I said I had receipts, that did not mean that that was the definition of an audio or a recording. That is a rumor that was started and it spread like wildfire.’</p><p>She then placed the blame of the mix up on Nene.</p><p>‘She said the word audio recording. I said I had receipts. I never used those words with her.’</p><p>When asked by the Sister Circle hosts if there is an audio recording of Cynthia trashing Leakes that exists, she responded: ‘Not to my knowledge. Have you heard one? When y’all hear it let me know ’cause I ain’t heard it yet.’</p><p>Although this makes snakegate even more confusing, she decided to clear up rumors that she wasn’t allowed to film with the ladies after the dramatic argument she had with Porsha Williams.</p><p>‘That is the first of my knowledge. I guess you guys will have to keep watching, but I will give you a teaser. I did film with the ladies a few times after Toronto, so you will continue to see me.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Yovanna suddenly turning on Nene?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeppMOius2aZKannaW5orXSoqlmrKWnu7R5zqdkp52emnqtscCknKxlmWK1osLEZqWerpWnerStyJ1kraCRqXq1tMSrnGavkah6orqMmqydoZ9ivLN50Z6aqKqUnruoeZJvZ2ltYWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
