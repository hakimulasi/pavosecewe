It’s true. I love Christmas. I love Thanksgiving. I love Easter (Easter candy is amazing, plus bunnies!). I love the Fourth of July. But Halloween sucks. No matter what year it is, no matter how many conversations we have about inappropriate Halloween costumes, no matter how many times people are like “please just wear a witch costume and call it day,” there are still people who don’t get it. Hilary Duff and her boyfriend Jason Walsh are two of those people.</p><p>Duff and Walsh attended the Casamigos Halloween party this weekend. They decided to do <a href=#>theme-couple costumes</a>. Hilary was the “pantless pilgrim” and Jason was “the Native American.” Again, stop it. Someone’s race is not a costume. Someone’s culture is not a costume. What else is there to say about this besides STOP DOING THIS. Jason Walsh did issue an apology, <a href=#>saying</a>: “I meant no disrespect. I only have admiration for the indigenous people of America. In hindsight I would not have made that decision. I apologize to anyone I may have offended.” Why do people still suck at apologizing? Just say “I’m really sorry. I’m an idiot.” Duff also apologized:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am SO sorry to people I offended with my costume.It was not properly thought through and I am truly, from the bottom of my ❤️sorry.</p><p>— Hilary Duff (@HilaryDuff) <a href=#>October 30, 2016</a></p><p>Fine. Whatever. This is why I hate Halloween!</p><p>Two incidental things. One, Chris Hemsworth also “dressed up” as <a href=#>a Native American/First Nations person</a> for a New Year’s Eve party last year. Last week, he finally got around to apologizing for it – <a href=#>you can see his Instagram here</a>. His apology was actually really comprehensive and it wasn’t “sorry you were offended.” Second incidental thing: as football season heats up, I still can’t believe that the Washington team is still allowed to call themselves that name. We wouldn’t, as a society, stand for a football team being named a derogatory word for African-Americans or Hispanic Americans or Asian-Americans. Why do we continue to allow it for the Washington football team?</p><p>Photos courtesy of Getty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbmlgaIJ6e8eio5qqqZSxtrLFrJabp6mbv6qxzZ2WnaqVqMCmsL6up5ikmaCyoK2%2Bp5itoaaarKK5xKugnJmelLOwvr6hmKWkn6yyprqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
