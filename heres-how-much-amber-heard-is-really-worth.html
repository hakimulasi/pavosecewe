The couple's Australia home, better known as "Diamond Head," sits on the coastal city of Gold Coast, slightly south of Brisbane. The $40 million property has 10 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a bar, a pool, and a tennis court, and is surrounded by 44 acres of land, according to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. While gorgeous, the home does hold a heavy past, as it was the location of Heard and Depp's infamous fight that resulted in his partially severed finger (reported&nbsp;<a href=#>OK!</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>The pair also shared a five-home penthouse in Los Angeles during their relationship. Among the inhabitants of their five homes included Heard and Depp, Depp's friend Isaac Baruch, Heard's sister Whitney Heard, and other friends,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Independent</a>&nbsp;reported. The penthouses are a part of the historic Eastern Columbia Building, and together feature 9 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and private terraces, to name a few of the amenities, per <a href=#>The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>As their divorce was playing out, Heard demanded that Depp allow her to live in three of the five penthouses and for the actor to continue covering living expenses for her, according to <a href=#>The Mirror</a>. Depp secured possession of the penthouses following his divorce from Heard and ultimately put them up for sale in 2017, with a combined $12.78 million price tag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW1oaH5xe8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZGir6a%2BjKGcmqqUYra0edGemKWkqWLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
