Most of these LGBTQ storylines are often in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moments.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But fans hope that all that will change when these 5 top gay marvel characters are given a chance to tell their story.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Phastos</h2><p>When Marvel’s <a href=# rel=follow>Eternals</a>&nbsp;premiered&nbsp;in November 2021, the LGBTQ+ community rejoiced because, after a long wait, they finally got to see MCU’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first openly gay superhero</a>, Phastos. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Played by <a href=# rel=follow>Brian Tyree Henry</a>, Phastos is married to his husband, Ben, played by Haaz Sleiman. The couple has a son named Jack Stoss.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And this time round, Marvel gave LGBTQ+ fans exactly what they were craving —&nbsp;a same-sex kiss between Phastos and his husband.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>2. Korg</h2><p>Everyone’s favorite rock alien, Korg, is gay in the comics and develops a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">romantic relationship</a> with Hiroim.</p><p>But fans were unsure how it would play out in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fortunately, they got the confirmation they needed in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Thor: Love and Thunder</a>&nbsp;when the Kronan warrior’s love story was played out.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the film, Korg and his partner, Dwayne, pair up to have a baby. They do this by holding hands over a molten pool for a month, and after that, a new Kronan is born.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>3. Valkyrie</h2><p>Valkyrie was confirmed as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bisexual</a> during&nbsp;Marvel Studios’ Hall H panel at Comic-Con&nbsp;in 2019 by queer actress Tessa Thompson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>“As the new king [of Asgard], she needs to find her queen,” Thompson said.&nbsp;But so far, Valkyrie’s queerness hasn’t been made clear on screen.&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok, we see a female lover in Valkyrie’s flashback, and in&nbsp;Thor: Love and Thunder,&nbsp;she is seen flirting with Jane Foster.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. America Chavez</h2><p>The latest addition to the top gay marvel characters list is America Chavez, played by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Xochitl Gomez</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Gomez's Chavez became the first Latin-American LGBTQ+ character to lead an MCU series.</p><p>Her character appeared in&nbsp;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,&nbsp;but her <a href=# rel="follow noopener">sexuality</a> was not explicitly confirmed.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But the Pride slogan on her trademark denim jacket seemed a good enough indication that&nbsp;MCU stayed true to Chavez’s comic origins.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Ayo</h2><p>In the comics series World of Wakanda,&nbsp;the Dora Milaje warrior, Ayo, falls in love with Aneka, the general of the Dora Milaje. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But Marvel has not&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;if she is gay in the MCU.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel=follow>Black Panther</a> producers faced backlash after it was reported that they had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deleted a scene</a> featuring Ayo flirting with a female general.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the scene was deleted, fans think that the fact that it was made confirms the warrior’s queerness.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BRrnqurdGvnKVlk52us63CrZyrq16dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
