"I was addicted to falling in love, and I think I probably hurt a lot of people in that process too, because a lot of people have been in love with me and I did not respect or honor that."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox then explained that it was her kids — she shares three sons, Noah Shannon, Bodhi Ransom, and Journey River, with her ex-husband Brian Austin Green — who changed her whole mindset on relationships and love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I had kids, something happened in me,"&nbsp;she shared.&nbsp; "... I think it’s a major part of my soul’s journey in this lifetime to not repeat my parents’ pattern with my kids, and I was always very aware of that, so this selfless person was born when I birthed my first child."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere during the interview, Barrymore questioned Fox about the worst thing she had ever done in a past relationship, to which Fox responded, "I don’t know if that’s something I can say on TV," before sharing the story regardless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I was young, I did have a temper and I was wild, I got mad and I took a bunch of paint and I painted a Friedrich Nietzsche quote all over [this guy's] wall, so he had to repaint his house afterwards," she recalled. "It was like a really angry quote about, like, how life is futile, you suck basically. So he had to repaint the bedroom."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "Anyone who dated me in my early 20s should probably write their own poetry book,&nbsp;because I was not a peach."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5ecWao6Whnpx6qrqMpaavnV2YvG6%2F05qprGWUp7K4ecGaqauxnaS%2FpnnSoaawZWhpfXGFkm4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
