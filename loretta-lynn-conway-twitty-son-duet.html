The song was released in 1973 as the first single and title track from the album of the same name.</p><p>“Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man” became the duo’s third No. 1 on the country chart. It stayed at No. 1 for a week, spending a total of thirteen weeks on that chart and making the two talented singers become a true powerhouse duo.</p><p>Decades after the debut of “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man,” Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty’s son, Michael Twitty, honored the late country legend with a series of songs! During the iconic “Remembering Conway Twitty” event at Lynn’s historic Loretta Lynn Ranch in Hurricane Mills, the two dazzled their audience with a slew of hits from the years Twitty and Lynn were performing together and dominating the country charts.</p><p>Of course, they did not leave the stage without performing one of the most memorable hits of the duo’s reign on country music: “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man.” It was indeed a magical performance, Lynn was sitting in a chair at center stage, and Michael sweetly took her hand as if he’s serenading her!</p><p>The moment between these two who are connected in an incredible way is definitely something to behold!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Song About A Struggling Couple</strong></h2><p>Written by Becki Bluefield and Jim Owen, “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man” details the struggles of a couple that is geographically separated by the Mississippi River. The two vigorously pledge that their love is too great to let the wide distance of the river keep them separated. Overcoming alligators and bouts of distraction, the man vowed to cross the river somehow, while the woman claimed she would go so far as to swim the distance.</p><p>“Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man. We get together every time we can. The Mississippi River can’t keep us apart. There’s too much love in the Mississippi heart. Too much love in this Louisiana heart,” the song goes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>You Will Rarely See Loretta Lynn without Conway Twitty</strong></h2><p>In the 1970s and into the early 1980s, you will rarely see Loretta Lynn’s name without “and Conway Twitty” alongside it. With duets like “Feelins’,” “After The Fire Is Gone,” and “Lead Me On,” they won Grammys and were awarded Top Vocal Duo at numerous awards shows. In addition to five No. 1 singles, they have seven other Top Ten hits between 1976 and 1981.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Conway Twitty died in 1993 due to abdominal aortic aneurysm after becoming ill while performing at the Jim Stafford Theatre in Branson, Missouri. This broke Lynn’s heart and was inconsolable.</p><p>During the anniversary of his death this year, Lynn honored the late country legend with a touching post on Instagram. “He was one of the best men I have ever known. He loved his family and loved music! Conway was the real deal,” Lynn wrote along with a slideshow of photos of the two together. “He was like a brother to me, and I couldn’t have asked for a better singing partner.”</p><p>Thanks to Conway Twitty’s son, Michael Twitty, his legacy goes to live on. Michael would often cover his legendary father’s songs at shows,</p><p>While we know no one could ever replace Conway Twitty, we sure enjoyed Michael’s performance with Loretta Lynn. It was like a blast from the past. Watch the performance below, and you’ll be glad you did.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursaSdrq%2Bzw5qgpbFemLyue8uoqZ6spJZ6rcXNp2Scp56srrp507CgraypYsCwuoydrJ6sXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
