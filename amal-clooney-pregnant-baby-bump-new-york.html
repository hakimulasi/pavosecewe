The international human rights lawyer stunned in a yellow dress as she made her way to the United Nations on Thursday afternoon on her way to speak out against ISIS at 'The Fight against Impunity for Atrocities: Bringing Da'esh to Justice'. <a class=hm-link href=#>George Clooney’s</a> wife showcased her tiny baby bump in a sixties inspired design, teamed with a matching coat and sunglasses. The previous evening, Amal looked radiant in a pink velvet dress, and clearly keen on keeping to the same colour block, matched with a pink coat. Wearing her long hair down, Amal joined the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie</a> to celebrate International Women’s Day at a charity event in the Big Apple.</p><p id=eLXENMwBqdTU><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY: Celebrities with twins</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/900ccdd3844d-amalunz-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eBqokl1OZ0lH data-wc=19><strong>Amal carried her growing bump with style as she made her way to the United Nations in New York</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02c4edcb598e-amal1z-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewZPBq7bGNKE data-wc=14><strong>On Wednesday night, Amal attended a charity event in an elegant red velvet dress</strong></p><p id=eW-pnCgx0-qx><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY: Iconic Celebrity couples</a></p><p id=ex5djnuapU9g data-wc=73>Recently, Amal <a class=hm-link href=#>opened up about her high-profile marriage to George</a> and the positive effects it has had on her career. Talking to BBC News at Six, the 39-year-old explained, "I think if there are more people who now understand what's happening about the Yazidis and ISIS, and if there can be some action that results from that, that can help those clients, then I think it's a really good thing to give that case the extra publicity that it may get."</p><p id=e7rb-cSM0KAc data-wc=87>Amal made her red carpet bump debut last month at the Cesar Awards in Paris. The mum-to-be glowed wearing a strapless white Versace gown that featured a feathered ombre skirt. George, who was honored with a career award at the event, praised his wife in his speech saying, “To my wife Amal, there isn’t a day that goes by that I’m not proud to be your husband. And I am excited about the years to come, and particularly the months to come. I love you very much.”</p><p id=ebVvqe2FUntA data-wc=87>Amal and George married in September 2014 in a wedding covered by <strong>HELLO!</strong> magazine. Amal wore a custom-made, French lace Oscar de la Renta dress which was embroidered with pearls and diamanté accents and featured a gorgeous lace overlay and off-the-shoulder sleeves. The groom, meanwhile looked dapper in a black tuxedo, which was created by his good friend Giorgio Armani, as part of his Made to Measure collection. "My verdict on being Mr and Mrs Clooney? It feels pretty damn great," George told <strong>HELLO!</strong> at the time.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
