Citing practical impossibility, the court stated, “The fetus has already reached 34 weeks of gestation and is now fully developed, preparing for its life outside the womb. Termination of pregnancy at this point is not tenable, if not impossible; and, therefore, the child will have to be allowed to be born,” as reported by Live Law.</p><p>Justice Devan Ramachandran, recognizing the sensitivity of the situation, directed the minor girl to be placed in the custody and care of her parents. The court further issued strict directives to ensure the safety of the victim, explicitly prohibiting any contact with her minor brother against whom allegations were made. The court stated, “To ensure that the applicable provisions of the law are not violated, petitioners 1 and 2 are hereby peremptorily directed to ensure that the 3rd petitioner’s brother is not allowed anywhere near her or to have access to her in any manner whatsoever. This shall also be ensured by the competent Authorities.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=s299ad543afe0882f3bf15be3ad8ab1bc data-wpel-link=internal><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Shura Khan Arbaaz Khan Marriage, Who is Arbaaz Khan Girlfriend?
