He was talking in his sleep, saying we got to get out of here,” she told the paper, adding that she plans to take her son to a therapist.</p><p>Gregory said she found out about the shooting when a neighbor asked her if she saw a report on TV.</p><p>“What school?” she said she asked. “‘Your son’s school.

There’s no way a 6-year-old would meet that criteria,” he added.</p><p>But Block noted that an adult could face misdemeanor charges if the pistol came from a home where the child lives because under state law, guns must be secured from kids under 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmaXFflq%2BjxYyzrp6qnpq%2Fbr%2FHqKtmmqlig27FxJqpZqecmXqiv4ysn55lpKe2prCMraZmm5%2Bjs6q%2FwpqrnmWXqrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
