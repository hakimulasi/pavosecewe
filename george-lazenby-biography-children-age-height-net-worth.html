What makes this very interesting is that it was the first time someone with no prior acting Experience was considered and taken for the big role.&nbsp;This was thanks to his ability to cut through the auditions and claim to be a skilled actor.</span></p><p><span>After the 007 role, this was the only time he would take the role because many things were different about him, leading to his popular line in the film;&nbsp;“That didn’t happen to the other guy.”&nbsp;This was one of his complaints during filming and the producers had a very difficult time working with him.&nbsp;George Lazenby would do better to sell cars again than any other James Bond film.</span></p><p><span>However, he landed a role in&nbsp;</span><span>Soldier Universal</span><span>&nbsp;(1971) and then&nbsp;</span><span>Who Saw Them Die?&nbsp;</span><span>in 1972. It was then revealed that he was broke in 1973, which forced him to go to Hong Kong, where he met Bruce Lee and was due to appear in a film with him before Lee’s sudden death.&nbsp;In fact, the two actors were supposed to have dinner that day to discuss their film together.&nbsp;</span><span>game of death</span></p><p><span>From then on, Lazenby continued in many other roles and returned with many films to his name, most recently as&nbsp;</span><span>A Winter Rose</span><span>&nbsp;(2014) and&nbsp;</span><span>Hunter</span><span>&nbsp;(2015).</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wealth-income-and-earnings></span><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The important thing is that George knows that Lazenby didn’t want to be an actor or a model, which is where it all started.&nbsp;Since finding his way, however, he hasn’t done badly, becoming one of the first male models to earn £8 a day while others took home the usual £4 a day.</span></p><p><span>With that, George Lazenby has a net worthwhich is estimated at $20 million.&nbsp;As an actor he made the most of his fortune.&nbsp;While this is a very significant fortune, many wonder what it would have been worth had he continued playing James Bond, a role that has opened more doors for many actors and helped others like Sean Connery and Roger Moore whose fortune it is earned has gone into hundreds of millions.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wife-and-children></span><strong><span>wife and children</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>To date, George Lazenby has been married twice and both marriages have ended in divorce.</span></p><p><span>The first woman he married was Chrissie Townsend in 1973 but the marriage didn’t last more than 3 years before ending.&nbsp;The union had two children;&nbsp;Zachary and Melanie to show, although Zachary died when he was 19 of complications from a malignant brain tumor.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t until 2002 that George would marry, this time it was Pamela Shriver again.&nbsp;After having three children, their marriage had faltered in 2008 when the former tennis player filed for divorce against her husband, claiming she suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the actor.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong><span>height</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>George Lazenby is a man of good height and build which enabled him to find success as a model in his early days.&nbsp;He has a height of 187.3 cm.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BVpL%2BosYylmLOdnpfGbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6vx6KjnaqVo3qis8Rmn56hl53BbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
