Brittany, 28, gave a peek inside her home while spending quality time with her son, Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III, on Friday, January 5, via her Instagram Story. The 13-month-old could be seen playing with a toy on a stylish black-tiled floor before crawling over the step into a shower.
“Into the dog shower he goes,” Brittany said from behind the camera as Bronze adorably clapped for himself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The NFL star and fitness trainer moved into their dream home in July 2023, per the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post</a>. They reportedly built the mansion on an 8-acre plot of land they purchased in 2020. In addition to the dog spa, the property also boasts a swimming pool, a par-3 golf hole and a custom-designed 50-yard football field.</p><p>The couple, who began dating in high school, wed in March 2022. Although Patrick is one of the most successful players currently in the NFL, he keeps his home priorities top of mind.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Everybody sees the game days. They don’t see the day-to-day grind. They don’t see how you have to manage playing football and being a dad and being a husband,” Patrick said during an episode of Netflix’s Quarterback docuseries, which followed three QB’s during the 2022 NFL season: Mahomes, <strong>Kirk Cousins</strong> and <strong>Marcus Mariota</strong>.</p><p>After a devastating team loss, Patrick assured viewers that the game isn’t all that matters. “It’s football. You’re gonna have highs. You’re gonna have the lows,” he said. “You put so much into this that you want to win, you want to succeed. And you want to win that Super Bowl at the end of the year. But I have to be a dad too. I have to be a husband.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpwaK62GakmqCforK0eceaqmacn5x6tLTOsJyrZZmjeqytzayYrGWTnsG6eceopJ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
