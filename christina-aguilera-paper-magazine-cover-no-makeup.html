But we've never seen <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Christina Aguilera</a> looking quite like this. The 37-year-old superstar has gone barefaced for the cover of the latest issue of magazine, and the pictures are causing an internet sensation. "I've always been someone that obviously loves to experiment, loves theatrics, loves to create a storyline and play a character in a video or through stage," she told the magazine in an interview. "I'm a performer, that's who I am by nature. But I'm at the place, even musically, where it's a liberating feeling to be able to strip it all back and appreciate who you are and your raw beauty."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d5e9847e370-xtina-papermag-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ev-HgASkhir data-wc=8><strong>This cover shot has sent fans into overdrive</strong></p><p id=e7bU2_fWPQk data-wc=68>And social media users were in agreement. One posted: "My god, I don't think she's ever looked more beautiful"&nbsp;and another added "the no makeup look makes Christina Aguilera look wow. She should permanently do away with makeup."&nbsp;And in reference to the singer's incredible comeback skills, one commented: "Nearly 20 years into the game and she still continues to surprise us. Can't wait for the next surprise...".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/383ff02b7da2-xtina-papermag-inline-z.jpg><p id=esF71D-C2IHA data-wc=62>In the interview Christina looked back on her 20-year career, saying: "I can't stay in a stagnant place for too long, which is why I think the position I was in with television just became very stifling," she said of her six-season stint as a judge on <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Voice</a></strong>. "I need movement, I need to go explore, be an artist, create and transform."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9eedc44a5f1e-xtina-papermag-bw-z.jpg><p id=elV_4p8sU0_v data-wc=69>She also addressed the backlash she got for her hyper-sexualised style in the era, noting that it's easier today for young artists to experiment and break the mould: "<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Madonna</a> had to go through it in her day, and she paved the way for my generation to come up. And paying it forward, now a younger generation is coming up and I'm loving what I'm seeing.
